The stretcher bars are reinforced with cross bars, very sturdy, hefty, and square. The canvas was a bit loose in one corner, (which is to be expected with changes in temperature during shipping), but I had no problem straightening it out, tight as a drum, when I applied the keys to the bars in the back. The linen is a nice medium texture. Excellent quality for a good price."

Changes in humidity can cause the canvas to slacken at any time, so a canvas that's well-stretched by the manufacturer may be taut in our warehouse and looser when it arrives to you.

Mine are 24 x 30 inches and have one crossbar for support. Adequate extra canvas should you need to restretch. Corner folds good not great. Stretch is quite tight. Plenty of staples. Canvas looks to me like Fredrix Yankee, good tooth, fairly heavy, and though only 2 coats of gesso I've not noticed any bleed-through even with pours. Comes with wooden keys for the corners but some are too thick for the slots, the only knock. You could do a little better on some of these points but you'd pay 75% more."

It comes already primed which made it easy to get started. It's a bit heavier weight cloth than regular canvas, but I actually liked that better, since I am using a mix of regular acrylic, heavy body acrylic, and some other media on this piece. Unfortunately due to a health issue I have not been able to work on the piece much to show any photos ( it is also going to be a surprise gift). Liquitex has made a great product, one that I will be using exclusively from now on.

      "review_desc": "I'm not a huge fan of Winsor & Newton, especially since they've been bought out by the ColArt Group. But I have to admit, their stretched cotton canvas is the best you can get. If you want better quality than this, you'll be stretching your own. My biggest problem with pre-stretched canvas has always been canvas tightness. I like my canvas nice and tight. I don't want it wiggling around while I'm trying to paint. This canvas is relatively tight right out of the package. And it comes with these cool adjustable wedges. These wedges take it to the next level. So if you work on cotton canvas, and you prefer to buy pre-stretched, I highly recommend that you give this product a try."

Little bit wrinkly on glued edge and the disc had a flat part like they couldn't quite cut a perfectly round pressed wood disc. I think framing might solve the aesthetic wobble. Will keep because it is too cheap to return & it's so tiny it's not worth the carbon footprint a return would entail. Fredrix is my go to canvas. Normally they provide perfect canvases.

However, fine linens often have an open weave where light can shine through the priming. In addition, in fine weaves it's not unusual for the priming to penetrate and show white spots on the back of the fabric, but since the canvas has been sized (and the sizing is clear), there is no harm to the linen fibers. Both characteristics are sometimes mistaken for pinholes, but they are not holes and not flaws. Nonetheless, we welcome you to return any item that does not meet your expectations.

      "review_desc": "We’re sorry to hear that your experience with this canvas has been an unhappy one. Changes in humidity can cause the canvas to slacken, and you can tighten the canvas using the corner keys that are pre-installed in the stretcher frame for this purpose. If the wood frame is warped, the best place to start is by removing any tensioning keys you’ve inserted and move the canvases away from any source of humidity. The frame may straighten if some stress that's causing it to bow can be removed, but it’s not uncommon with warped canvases that the canvas fabric must be removed and put on new stretcher bars. Our Product Information Team is more than happy to assist with the materials and techniques you would need. Product Specialists are available weekdays from 8am to 5:30pm CST at 1-800-933-2542 or info@dickblick.com, and they're happy to help!"
