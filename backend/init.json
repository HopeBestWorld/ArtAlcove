It comes already primed which made it easy to get started. It's a bit heavier weight cloth than regular canvas, but I actually liked that better, since I am using a mix of regular acrylic, heavy body acrylic, and some other media on this piece. Unfortunately due to a health issue I have not been able to work on the piece much to show any photos ( it is also going to be a surprise gift). Liquitex has made a great product, one that I will be using exclusively from now on.

If you want better quality than this, you'll be stretching your own. My biggest problem with pre-stretched canvas has always been canvas tightness. I like my canvas nice and tight. I don't want it wiggling around while I'm trying to paint. This canvas is relatively tight right out of the package. And it comes with these cool adjustable wedges. These wedges take it to the next level. So if you work on cotton canvas, and you prefer to buy pre-stretched, I highly recommend that you give this product a try.",

However, fine linens often have an open weave where light can shine through the priming. In addition, in fine weaves it's not unusual for the priming to penetrate and show white spots on the back of the fabric, but since the canvas has been sized (and the sizing is clear), there is no harm to the linen fibers. Both characteristics are sometimes mistaken for pinholes, but they are not holes and not flaws. Nonetheless, we welcome you to return any item that does not meet your expectations.

Anyway, a few years back I suffered a stroke which somewhat curtailed my model hobby that started again after I retired. So these past four years I got back into coloring books. Not all the time mind you but just to break the boredom. Then this past month I purchased some adult based coloring books for markers, and that got me to thinking about these markers I had down in my studio cabinet. Lo and behold, they are still quite functional, but I have a few that after reopening the caps, they start to dry out until I put the cap back on and let it rest for a day or two. I think a new set is in the future. Yet, after almost 40 years, I can't complain about a very good purchase.",

My only issue is when i bought them from DickBlick.com is that the price originally said free shipping on purchases over a dollar amount that i definitely exceeded with a 72 color Copic marker purchase. Then a few days later i got an email saying they couldn't cover the shipping cost. I feel like this was a bait-and-switch. I already was expecting shipping so i payed the EXTRA $ just to get them shipped. That didn't leave me with a great feeling about ordering from your website ever again. I live in Hawaii, USA. If you do not include Alaska and Hawaii in your free shipping offer then you should change your website to specifically say \"Free shipping in the continental United states. Does not include Alaska and Hawaii.\" Aloha, Tammi",

I didn't know when I bought them that they had replacement cartridges, it's a great idea. Even just the ability to custom build a palette and save some space for on the go is great.

The dual tip connection feature is a great idea as well as being able to order handles, connectors and fills. I would highly recommend people purchase at least a small set to get an idea of what they can do. I give it 4 stars because blending wet over wet didn't seem to do anything on various papers.",

I bought several of these Holbeins and about 4 of them work well for me, like, I love them, but the other 6 break and break and break. I can't even sharpen them--they sharpen into nothing, it's heart-breaking (and EXPENSIVE). I'm very sad and will not be buying these again, I'll stick to more consistent brands.",

First is that some of the colors are very similar to the point that they're pretty much the same color. The purplish red, purple, and purple violet are all basically the same color. The pencils also appear to be magenta rather than purple. They could have added a couple more true purples and pinks rather than have 3 of the same color. I found that many other colors are also similar. I added some photos of my swatch chart, though many of them look even more similar in person. They could have eliminated these duplicates and added a better range of colors, such as true purples, pinks, skin tones, and a wider range of grays and browns. It seems more like a 72 set than a 120 set. My second complaint is that the metallic print on the barrel of the pencil is nearly impossible to read. This makes it extremely difficult to find a specific color. I find myself squinting and moving the pencil around to catch the light in just the right way. Despite these flaws, I am still rating them 4 stars because they are a dream to use.",

The white isn't particularly opaque, but I don't use white. They don't have lightfastness ratings, pigment info or color names on the pencils, but you can buy them open stock (in fact, I did), so I'd consider them student grade.",

It has amazing tonal qualities from a light (gray) all the way to a deep black with almost no shine distinctive of the Ebony pencils. This is fast becoming my favorite graphite pencil and likely to replace the Ebonys in future work. I also got the Pitt graphite 12B and10B. I recommend them hands down to everyone that works in pencil as it feels good in the hand and is consistent in quality. I will be ordering a lot more so I can have them on hand when I use them up.",

      "review_desc": "This is a cynical review, so I'll apologize now. First of all, these are good pencils. We are so inundated with digital technology: social media, short form video, phone notifications all day long. So, I'm rooting for pencil, paper and slow art. We've bought the old Blackwing Palominos and 60Xs and enjoyed using them. Had no problems with breaking leads or splintering cedar. But we paid a pretty penny for these pencils, likely more than they are worth... This is kind of like a special edition candy bar. Decent, but it's the same candy bar with a fancy/funny wrapper. What grade is a particular Blackwing lead? HB? 2H B? number 2? Who knows? I don't. Botanical artists have written blog posts on pencil brands, lead hardness, ability to sharpen and lifespan. They differ about favorite brands, but they agree that brands differ. So, lead grades aren't a precise science. I'll admit that a 2H Hi Uni and a 2H Tombow are different hardnesses. But when you just get a grade of \"firm\" it seems a bit loosy goosey. And expensive. For comparison, the beloved Tombow Mono is about $1.50 per pencil and you know exactly what you are getting. No pretty boxes or paint finishes, but cheaper, more consistent, and with a long track record. You could spend as much money on a Hi Uni as a Blackwing Era pencil and again you will have a pretty good idea of what you are getting with the Hi Uni. The Blackwings sure are fun to give as a gift, though. They present well and look nice on your recipient's desk. That's the brilliant aspect of the Blackwings. They get people interested in old, analog media. Again, this is great marketing and these are good pencils, but they are pretty pricey for a mystery pencil. So, I wouldn't recommend these to a friend (see below, I had to choose between \"yes\" and \"no\"). But I would give a set to a friend if the box design echoed a special event in their life.",

I look forward to continuing to use these; so far they seem just fine in quality and craftsmanship. These pencils were the only item of my order to arrive at my house in the shipment, though the invoice said nothing about a backorder or separate shipment. I was missing two other items from my order. I contacted customer service regarding the missing items and received a prompt reply and apology.

The thick core offers tremendous versatility, especially if sharpened with a knife, and can accomplish both fine and broad lines, and a range of tones. The best pencil for sketching on the go, as all I need is this one pencil, my pocket knife to sharpen it, and maybe a bit of grey eraser! It's also excellent for finished pencil drawings! I can do a whole drawing with just this pencil, but sometimes I do like combining it with a General's Draughting one (for the preliminary sketch) and the Carbon Sketch (for the final, darkest black notes). General's makes very high quality pencils\u2014made in the USA!\u2014and I can't recommend their products enough! #sweepstakes",

The design is much more interesting than a regular yellow pencil, the lead stays sharp for a looong time and the erasers work flawlessly (not wearing down too quickly). I use these pencils for simple sketching or jotting down notes or even measurements on woodwork. They're just really good for every day use! I splurged a bit on the 72 pack because I often lose pencils or use up the eraser too quickly, but I can say these will last me a long time.",

I think I've had maybe 5 pencils that had the lead break once even after being used by 500 students a week in my art room. That's five pencils for the whole school year. Never shred or splinter. I only put new pencils out after the mid term break because they got too short. I do have the students use little metal hand held sharpeners, not traditional ones. The amount of money saved on pencils is fantastic.",

      "review_desc": "I recently picked out 12 oil pastels from the open stock at a Blick store for my birthday, for every 3 my mother bought for me the price went down. I was able to build my own set. Not only do these have the absolute best pigment quality and smooth creamy texture but their size and shape reduce significantly the pain I usually have when drawing/painting from my rheumatoid arthritis- these are perfect for anyone with hand or wrist pain, not to mention you save money as the Grands last about 8-10 times as long as a regular sized oil pastel. Nobody can beat Sennilier when it comes to quality of their products, and no one else has such a wide variety of colors to choose from! I use these to sketch sculpture ideas (I can make the sketching look much more 3D w/these), in mixed media and encaustic projects, with OMS and wood turpentine for paintings, and even to decorate some of my porcelain sculptures. There is nothing to compare to these- my only problem is since I didn't buy these as a set with a box, I am struggling to find the right container to store them in so they won't break or rub off on each other too much.",

      "review_desc": "I reobtained Pentel last year because they were on the vegan list on Double Check Vegan (which is now crossed off), but looks like it is said otherwise in the Q&A. However, I'll not let my ethical bias get in the way of this review. First off, people are right about the smell. There is a gas-like smell to them (a smell I don't remember a while back when I had my first set many years ago). While it may not have bothered me too much, this may trigger headaches in others. It states long-lasting fade-resistant color. From my personal experience with testing and other artists who have done their own tests at home, I would NOT recommend these for commission works because most of the colors will not last long. I personally would keep these for sketchbook use and other fun things (If anything, you can do what I do and sell prints that'll last longer than the original art). Anyway, depending on weather, the blendability is a bit on the waxy side, but it'll definitely be waxy and crumbly if it's cold (goes the same with other alike oil pastels). The day was warmer when I worked on the female cardinal and had an easier time blending in colors than I did with the male cardinal, which was a bit cold in my room during the time of painting. The colors aren't deeply pigmented hence you can see the burnt sienna acrylic underpainting a bit on the white part of her belly. You can also see through the background of the purple fish. The amount of layering for these projects felt limiting, and it definitely didn't help when the underpaintings somewhat ended up a bit smooth than I wanted. They may not be Neopastels nor layer as much as a few other brans, but I still feel I can do plenty enough with these. Again, my ethical bias aside, I had fun doing these painterly pieces and I recommend them as starters (if you really insist on softer oil pastels that are better on your wallet than Neopastels, Holbein, and Sennelier, try either Lightwish, Mungyo or another alike brand).",

In addition, the artwork provided with this review is not my original design, I found an image online to use as a reference. That said, these are some really nice oil pastels at the student level. Some colors struggle to show up on darker paper hence why I took off a star. I wish I could give half points as I would rate these 4.5 out of 5 and not just a 4. I actually prefer using these on regular construction paper, I believe my image is done on Tru-Ray brand and is done on a light gray color. I found I liked them a bit less on heavily textured pastel papers like mi-teintes. Best used with high pressure and letting the pastels do most of the blending work. My examples was done completely using the 36 color set. This set is proof great work can be made with materials that don't have to break the bank.",

You can make very gorgeous artwork with these (with enough practice, of course). But it's fantastic for a beginner (or even advanced oil pastel artist), mainly due to the fact it's around $5-6 for a pack of 28. That's more than enough to get started. I do wish Crayola can make an even wider selection (that isn't the bulk one clearly for classroom use).",

I didn't have time to work with the oil/wax sticks for long, I just played with them a little bit, just to get an idea of how they feel and how I could integrate them into my mixed media art. So far I like them. I think they are what they say they are, a combo of oil and wax \"pastels\" (more % of wax than oil IMO), with good coverage, with vivid colors and some earthy ones included in the full set, clean pigments and excellent lightfastness. I think that they are close to the Neocolor I series in how they work, but with even better lightfastness, if that is even possible. For example, I saw that the ultramarine in the Neoart series is marked LF I (excellent), whereas the same pigment ultramarine in the Neocolor I is marked only as LF II (good), so I might choose the Neoart one to work on a piece that I would like to sell, just to be extra sure. My advice would be to buy several open stock sticks first and play with them before you commit to bigger sets, they are not cheap!",

These new Neoart pastels are one of my favorite things they've ever done! These are not the same as the Neoart crayons made 10-15 years ago. Those were a different texture and water-soluble. These are waterproof. Like seriously, perfectly waterproof. The texture is almost exactly like Neocolor, but with an even easier laydown, better blending and an even shinier, richer finish when rubbed smooth. The colors can absolutely appear to glow! I hope they expand the color range to match Neocolor II or Luminance, but do not replace Neocolor with these. They are similar but still very different products, and I would really miss the Neocolor! I plan to use these along with both types of Neocolor and my Luminance pencils. They all work great together! These are fantastic for sketching, and I'll have fun using them in sketchbooks and journals. They're also perfectly capable of making a pastel painting worthy of display. They lay down smoothly, layer well and blend nicely, without being smeary or muddy. It's really nice that they're waterproof and don't smudge as easily as Neopastel. They really are perfect for journals! I just want to see more colors!",

The 36 set has a nice assortment of colors including a number of good colors for skin tones. The sticks are much larger than my trusty Pentel Oil Pastels - both longer and at least double the size in diameter. Sticks seem a bit softer than the Pentels. I tried them out on a piece of Strathmore Acrylic paper which has a nice linen surface giving plenty of tooth for the oil pastel. The paper also provided a nice textured finish. The Faber-Castell Polychromous Pencils will work on top without sinking into the oil pastel. That's nice for some finish line work.

I bought these for plein air studies and sketches, and the nice size case & sleeve (which fit in my small backpack & won't fall open while I'm walking) and wrote the previous review after only sampling the colors and without wiping off the surface of the sticks first. Though they did not show a white surface haze, like some waxy student brands when you first get them, they did have a somewhat hard surface layer that wiped right off, and now they really blend and behave quite nicely for a student brand, and are soft enough to allow dabs of impasto color on top of other layers, which is really wonderful & a pleasant surprise. At least so far (it's winter), they are not affected by heat going places with me in the car, as some other more expensive brands are, so they will be just perfect for what I got them for. I am going to wear out the lovely light blending colors way too soon, though ... fortunately, at the price Dick Blick sells them for, I will just buy more sets when colors run out. My 4 stars consider the price of this product. Of course, they are not better quality than Senneliers (which I gave a low review to because in my area, they simply melt into unusable goo), which are almost 6 times the price, but are a solid 4 stars compared to other student brands.

I have used just about every other artist and student grade oil pastel sold in the US, and find they all have qualities that make them useful. However some stand out from the herd,and some don't. For me, these don't. The Faber Castell brand is very reliable,and these pastels have nothing really wrong with them. But, to me, they are not outstanding in any way compared to other brands in the student category. They are okay. I only bought the 12-piece set, and can only comment based on that. The dark colors would be hard to tell from an artist grade pastel. They seemed to lay down pretty smoothly and opaquely. The lighter tints were obviously waxier in texture and don't have the level of pigment that you would want for opacity. Other than that, the price per set is affordable, and these would be okay for beginning students, or for sketchbook use. I am neutral about recommending them - like I said, they are OK but not special. For what it's worth, if you are a beginner or need to save money, I would recommend the super-cheap Pentel oil pastels over these . Despite their price and student grade rating, they are quite nice in terms of pigment load, soft texture and range of colors.",

They do allow me to seamlessly integrate my Faber Castell Polychromos pencils over them, or FC Albrecht Durer watercolor pencils for underpainting, as *most* (but not all) of the colors are good matches with those pencils, but they are quite hard and do not blend as well as other student brands. I think they'd be very frustrating for someone just starting in oil pastels. I would recommend Cray Pas Expressionist over these for beginners in this wonderful medium of oil pastel.",

      "review_desc": "The tin box containing these oil pastels are a bit flimsy. Opening the box for the first time, I was intrigued by how the sticks were covered in a layer of oil (check image) and had to wipe them off. I then made some swatches on the Winsor and Newton pastel paper (check images). Some good points: These oil pastels are soft and blendable, but not soft enough to layer over other soft oil pastels in my experience. Bad points: Compared to other artist grade oil pastels, the opaqueness of these sticks is inferior. Their coverage is also patchy and inconsistent (comparable to the expressionist line, just softer), most ostensibly seen with the Medium green stick. It might be because of the paper I was using, but for me so far these pastels have been underperforming as supposedly artist grade oil pastels. Unless they improve this product, I don't see myself returning to it. #sweepstakes",

      "review_desc": "I purchased the 30 set to use as a travel and art class set. The tin with higher quality artist grade pigment + Lightfast with the non-toxic AP rating was a plus. Pros: AP label - so nothing known to be toxic. Soft but not too soft - i.e. not gooey lipstick soft. Blend well, 30 set has a good range of colors for blending. Pigmented. Mix cleanly. White is quite decent. Packed in a sturdy travel tin. Sticks are identical in size to Sakura Cray-Pas Expressionist. Did a small test drawing on vellum cardstock. Used my mini Clay Shapers to blend and clean up the edges which worked well. Cons: Made in China - hopefully W&N supervises the manufacturing closely to maintain their quality standards.",

The plastic storage container is a huge plus-- it is very sturdy & has a hold-tight slot for each color. The kids have a much easier time finding the color they're looking for, and seem to do a better job of taking care of the pastels. No more mounds of small pieces heaped into a box!!!

These are only slightly creamier than the Expressionist OPs but my disappointment is minor. I usually don't put down more than two layers, nor do I use them for impasto techniques, but rather spread them and rub them in with my fingers or rubbing stumps. For that reason, extreme creaminess is not that important to me, and I get more mileage out of my OPs. Also, I'm too cheap to splurge on Holbein or Sennelier OPs. I will slurge on Holbein individual sticks as I use up my favorite colors, since the Specialists are not available in open stock...another disappointment. I'd expect any professional grade material to be available in open stock. Not a huge disappointment as the sets are very well priced, but who needs a ton of less used colors when you only need a couple. Overall, I'm very pleased with these #blicksweepstakes",

I would recommend these for children, they are probably an excellent deal for teachers or child care providers. For artists they are okay in sketchbooks but like the Pentels they don't have much opacity and similarly leave a lot of crumbs when blending and added multiple colors. Better than the Pentels but if you want something that is a little better quality for sketchbooks and artwork that isn't as expensive as the Neopastel or Sennelier, go with the Cray-Pas Expressionists. In fact, I'd even recommend the cray-pas junior over these, unless you just want something super cheap for little ones. I gave it two stars instead of one because you can buy a giant pack of over 400 for something like $50 and unlike the Pentels you can buy just packs of white or black and they don't smell like gasoline, I think they're great for kids. #sweepstakes",

      "review_desc": "I use these as a watermedia tool in paintings on their own, or dry on metal or wood. They provide excellent color vibrancy, much better than the \"gelatos\" and gel sticks that are popular right now--these stay vibrant when wet and don't need a gesso underpainting like the gelatos to get the same result. They also come in a great range of metallics, which I just got, and I am excited about using them! They lift easier and go down more opaque than my traditional watercolors or inks, and while this is a minus if I used them with the paints, it is a great way to get other effects when I use them on their own, especially granular textured effects. I am not a mixed media artist--what I look for as a watercolorist is pigment vibrancy and quality as well as lightfastness, and these provide all that. This was the first media outside of traditonal watercolor paints or inks that I have tried to use seriously, and they produced very exciting results.",

      "review_desc": "When I first became interested in using oil pastels in my art work, a friend suggested I begin with a budget friendly brand likely marketed for children. It sounded like a good idea so I could get a sense of using them but toss them out if I hated them without being out too much money. I chose the Maped brand on Blick and when it arrived, boy was I pleased! I have since tried other budget friendly brands like Faber Castell and Mungyo but I just love my Maped brand. It has a smooth application with little hand pressure. The coverage is better than many brands in it's price range that I've tried. I like to blend 2 colors usually and that always guarantees complete coverage but just one application of the Maped covers just as well. I use Turpenoid to blend out larger areas and only my finger for smaller areas. Honestly, for just fooling around doing a first sketch these are amazing. Obviously not lightfast, just practical before doing a permanent piece. These are smooth, not grainy, good coverage, nice pigment, tapered ends, all the color choices you need with 24 sticks, and very reasonably priced. Recommended for casual sketching and doodling or outdoor first sketch impressions.",

My 30 year old set of Rembrandt pastels are better than this Sennelier set. A bit of a disappointment. #sweepstakes",

      "review_desc": "I am a pastel painter, and I prepare my own rigid surfaces using hardboard or wood panels. These panels may have an aggressive tooth when ready for the studio, My favorite pastels used to block in my background or underpainting are Townsend Terrages due to the fact that they seem to have a fine pumice property that suits my gessoed surface beautifully. The Townsend Terrages pastels grip and adhere to my surface's gritty texture and fills every square millimeter with beautiful pastel color. The adjacent colors I apply are easily blended for soft edges when the picture needs them. The large rectangular shape of Townsend Terrages allows for quick coverage of area without hard telltale streaks on the surface. The Townsend Terrages Manganese Violet 42 is an ideal pastel choice to manage the red violet hint of the atmosphere where the landscape or seascape meets the horizon. This particular tint really approximates the distant haze effect and pushes a pastel's horizon line deep into the perspective. I am happy I found this particular Townsend Terrages color as well many other wonderful pastels Townsend offers. The selection of \"darks\" is also an important part of my pastel palette.",

I ordered 9 individual colors and 3 of them were broken. Blick replaced them, but one of the replacements also arrived broken even though they did a superb job of packing them in bubble wrap the second time. I won't be buying these again.

Most of the colors (whole range) are rated either excellent or very good, but if lightfastness is important to you, go to Art Spectrum's website, open the Resources tab, and download the color chart for these Soft Pastels.

Fortunately, I knew that this box contained soft pastels, and I was (somewhat) prepared for the transfer of white to every single thing between the door and what would be the (now multiplied in number) soft pastels' eventual home. Dick Blick has since proven that they are able to successfully contain these pastels through the shipping process, so hopefully everyone will now receive theirs intact and with less need of a shower.

      "review_desc": "Golden Open Acrylics changed the game for acrylic painters. You can mix large amounts of paint and have a palette that stays workable for days, avoiding wasted paint and time remixing. Colors blend on the substrate like oils for beautiful soft edges. I use Open titanium white for tinting regular heavy-body paint, which lets me control the drying time, leveraging the advantage of using fast-drying acrylic paint. Using an Open medium helps control the drying time for darker colors. You will have to take care when using water. Water may reactivate touch-dry Open paint on your substrate and you could end up pulling it right off, even with a brush loaded with paint. But with practice, you'll find the limits of what works and doesn't work. The bottom line is, your options will be more Open with Golden Open acrylics. The widemouth 8 oz jar makes it easy to use every bit of paint. Putting some plastic wrap over the top before closing the jar makes it easy to open every time. I'd give Open paints a 5-star review anyway. It's just gravy to do it for #sweepstakes",

This is an incredibly weak yellow oxide. I made the mistake of thinking it was what is usually called Transparent yellow iron oxide, which is a less opaque alternative to yellow oxide or ochre. In this case, it's so poorly pigmented to the point of acting like dirty high flow medium when mixed with other brands' acrylic inks or with other Golden High Flow paints. If used alone it's a passably decent transparent wash of earthy yellow. But overall, not really in line with what I expect from Golden paints. #sweepstakes",

The coverage is phenomenal, it blends really well, and the colors are vibrant. The only negative point is the containers they come in. There isn't an easy way to pour paint out for distribution, and what ultimately happens is that paint crusts up around the lip of the jar, the lid eventually won't go on correctly, and the paint dries out with only half of it used. Almost every jar has done this-- either it dries out completely, or it's just a thick, gelatinous mess by the time you get about half of it used. I wish they would come up with a better lid/container solution because this paint is such an affordable alternative.",

I purchased another brand in a few colors and within two years they were separated and drying. I had no problems with the Chroma brand. I also purchased the pumps, which I do not recommend for long term storage. It was easier for my students to get a reasonable amount, but I needed to do an extensive clean out each spring or fall to use the pumps again. The colors I ran out of, I repurchased in the pint size for ease of pouring. I saw these paints, without pumps, at a workshop I attended at a local university, which is why I tried them initially.",

      "review_desc": "I bought this shield to do precise erasing of botanical drawings. Because other reviewers complained about this shield being flimsy, and others talked up the Staedtler, I decided to buy both so that I could compare them. And they are different. This shield is about a centimeter longer than the Staedtler and the holes are a little larger, though they almost copy the original shapes. These holes are more rounded and not as narrow as the competitor's shield. I agree with others that the Westcott feels thinner and less robust. So I measured thickness with a micrometer. Yes, I actually did. The Westcott measures a pretty reproducible 0.09 mm in multiple places around its perimeter. The Staedtler, however, measures 0.12 mm. Again, I made multiple measurements around the perimeter of each and the Westcott is about 25% thinner. You really can feel the difference. In the end, though, they both function as an erasing shield just fine. But I don't think that the Westcott will prove to be as durable. It already has a divot (see photo). One of these will stay in my home; one will travel with my kit. Either way, they need a wallet or sleeve. The Staedtler will just fit in a wallet. The thinner Westcott is too big. It was interesting to compare these two, but I would probably buy two Staedtlers instead of one of each.",

Stiff when new, it became leather hard and crumbly when old. Yes, the pencil's ferule was designed to allow the user to exchange a new one, but to what avail? Your options were limited to those pink erasers. Today, the legendary Blackwing 602 has been resurrected with an eraser to match the quality of its smooth lead and aromatic cedar casing - a rarity in the pencil world. While this new incarnation of the 602 is a close match to the original, it's new pink replacement eraser is not - and that is a good thing! It is far superior to it. #sweepstakes",

It cuts like butter with an exacto knife and can be easily shaped. I got this with some Kimberly pencils and thought it would be worthless since I had such bad memories of those pink erasers in my youth ruining pictures with smudges or pink marks.

      "review_desc": "This review is the counterpart to the review that I wrote about the inferior competitor to the Staedtler trading shield. I bought this shield (the Staedtler) to do precise erasing of botanical drawings. Because other reviewers complained about the Westcott shield being flimsy, and others talked up the Staedtler, I decided to buy both so that I could compare them. And they are different. This shield is about a centimeter shorter than the Westcott. This is not an issue and actually makes it a bit more portable. I agree with other reviewers that the Staedtler feels more sturdy. So I measured thickness with a micrometer. Yes, I actually did. The Westcott measures a pretty reproducible 0.09 mm in multiple places around its perimeter. The Staedtler, however, measures 0.12 mm. Again, I made multiple measurements around the perimeter of each and the Westcott is about 25% thinner. You really can feel the difference. They both function as an erasing shield just fine, however. In the end I think that this one, the Staedtler, will be more durable. The substantially thinner Westcott already has a divot (see photo). One of these will stay in my home; one will travel with my kit. Either way, they need a wallet or sleeve. The Staedtler will just fit in a wallet. The thinner Westcott is too big. It was interesting to compare these two, but I would probably buy two Staedtlers instead of one of each",

Did a swatch sheet on Bristol Vellum with various lines of hatching, crosshatching, stippling, scribbling, etc. They show their characteristics well and are the same quality product of my student years. This particular set does what you would want for a pen & ink artist drawing set. I later purchased, judging by my swatch sheet effects, extra 102 (crow quill) & 107 hawk quill) nibs along with extra holders. This allows for ongoing work as some soak in the Speedball pen cleaner. The 56 \"student\" is a good way to begin as it is easy to control. The 108 flexible requires diligence but produces a line of varying thickness which can be quite nice but takes more practice than the others in holding and gliding across the surface. The Bristol smooth might be a better choice for practice.",

There are a lot of different pen and ink sets out there, and not all of them are meant for writing -- I only discovered after I bought one kind of nib that it was only meant for pen and ink drawings and couldn't be used for lettering (strokes can only be made in one direction, downwards, and not up). Some nibs are good for some kinds of writing, and others for other kinds, so it helps to have a selection of nibs. This package is a good value for a beginner who's just figuring out what they want to do.",

      "review_desc": "I found these Speedball calligraphy fountain pens after working with the Pilot Parallel pens for some time. The Pilot Parallels are great for calligraphy, but the smallest size nib they offer is 1.5mm, and the ink flows quite freely from them, making it difficult to produce smaller calligraphic letters. The Speedball pen nibs come in 1.1mm, 1.5mm, and 1.9mm and I've found that the ink flow is less heavy than the Pilot Parallel pens, so it's easier to produce those tiny letters, while still retaining the line variation necessary for great looking calligraphy. The pen body itself is nothing fancy, just sturdy plastic. It also features a small window so you can see when you're running low on ink. The cap is secure, and posts on the back of the pen nicely while writing or drawing. The only thing I don't love about these pens is that the interior of the pen body is made to only fit the short standard international fountain pen cartridges. There are little plastic bumps inside the pen body shaft which prevent any longer cartridges from fitting. These bumps actually hold the cartridge in place inside the pen when it's assembled, so be careful when disassembling the pen because the cartridge might fall out from the nib and spill ink. It would be nice to be able to fit a longer cartridge in there, but it's easy enough to change to a new cartridge, or refill the old one from an ink bottle with a flat syringe. Overall, these pens are a quality and completely affordable writing or drawing instrument.",

      "review_desc": "I have not opened my new package of these but have used these in the past. These Maru nibs allow for extremely thin lines. although these nibs are designed for thin lines, they also are flexible enough for a fairly thick line. Some art supplies stores sell cheap pen holders for these round nibs which have a skinny handle. those cheap pen holders cause my hand to cramp up. The Kuretake Zig (Tachikawa) pen holder does not cramp my hand yet fits the round maru nib as well as the Saji, G, and School nibs. I believe many Shojo type manga artists use this nib for details such as hair. Because hair strands are so numerous this nib seems to dull faster than my other nibs. I think it is odd they only include 2 instead of 3 or more nibs in the package, still this is a very good nib. This nib allows for lines comparable to the finest Micron pens, but without the worries of breaking the tip. I would buy this in combination with either the G nib or School nib for figure drawing. The Saji is supposed to be used for backgrounds but can also produce figures.",

It worked sort of ok for the smallest nib but not at all for the larger ones. I decided maybe the ink, which was opened and seemed ok to me, might be too thick for the pen. I removed the refillable cartridge and put on a standard black cartridge and voila! A different outcome altogether. Much smoother with no skipping using all nib sizes. So if you have trouble be sure to consider the ink you're using. And if you are not a seasoned calligrapher, remember to be sure you are holding the pen the way it is made to be held. I like the feel of the pen a lot.",

No more boring standard line weight with these nibs. There is however a slight learning curve. A slight increase in pressure will result in a wider line. If you are new to dip pen nibs, you may want to try the Speedball 512 or 513 nib. They are firmer and easier to work with but, don't have as thick as a line that you can get with the 101 or 99.

The book isn't as informative as I had hoped it would be for a beginner. I ended up picking up a calligrapher's bible. That said; I find myself using both books to accomplish meet my rudimentary needs. There are a few good pointers in Speedball's book that are useful. If I had to do it all over again, I might have bough each separately as I can only learn one handle and nib at a time.",

I love the variety of nibs and holders as I can use them for both calligraphy and ink drawings. I was less imressed with the ink containers as there are no seals in the lids and I can see ink seeping out and making a huge mess. Rather than include a just few colors of ink, I'd have gladly bought my own if there was a complete set of nibs. All in all, I'm glad I spent the extra money for this set.

Layering the purple and and greens makes a magnetic deep dark value. They adopt the sheen of the surface you draw on. If your paper is matte, they dry to a clean flat matte. If your paper has a very smooth finish, they develop a subtle sheen. The black is truly black. Even under direct sunlight I cannot detect any add-mixtures of pigments. The tips are consistently square with gentle precise rounding at the corners. That tends to make normal handwriting seem special, and good handwriting seem like Art.

As you can see from my images (not my best lettering): - the Dark Green is pretty decent, as it's a true green and I was able to get nice crisp sharp lines. - The Red however, for some reason, didn't have sharp edges AND in-person, it looks more orange-red than a true red (however, from my photo, it looks red). Trust me... I'm picky with my reds and this is more of an orange red. - The Metallic Green is fairly decent. Again, edges not as crisp as the other green (maybe they sent me 2 bum/used pens?) and as you can see on the black paper, it shows up as a silver-ish green. Bottom line, I probably would not purchase again. Am looking for red & green chisel markers for Cmas (med to broad point) -- like the Elegant Writers. Maybe I'll try to \"sharpen\" these myself with my xacto knife. Even then, though, I'm disappointed with the red color. Decent price though!",

Yes, the drawing pads are more expensive and ivory color and only 24 sheets to a pad but it is beautiful fine, smooth paper and heavy enough for finish work. I splurge and buy a 1/2 dozen every year.

      "review_title": "Holbein is great",
      "review_desc": "Let me start by saying these are quality inks. I thought they would be more opaque but here's my approach: 1: opacity- added Holbein gouache of similar tones to my inks. I still have to paint my colors twice on watercolor paper for full opacity. But this makes your inks more powerful than Holbeins acrylic gouache and In desired consistency. This will make your inks stronger than most available for purchase. Holbein I hope you're listening. We need more opaque colors that aren't pastel. This is a sure thing. 2: tip dry nib or airbrush- make a mix of glycerine/propylene glycol to make an acrylic retarder. I used vape juice bottles so I can add drops to however much I'm using at the time. This is the only way I was able to outline black with a nib. I add about 7-8 drops in a small cap and go to town. These are just things that have helped me out over the last few months. These aren't things that are necessary by any means. Just sharing some tricks that have made these my favorite new paints. I'm only leaving four stars because I feel like this ink has potential to be the absolute best if they added their gouache to it. Even to just make an extension off of this product. Then we'd have the opaque and transparent sets, that way you're making everyone happy. I also wish I could purchase bigger bottles. Overall Holbein has my business! The Japanese make amazing art supplies and I'm very happy that dick blick carries these products for all of us to try and use.",

In the cartridge I've had no separation of the pigment, and the pen has worked perfectly since I refilled it, other than a bit of initial leaking but I suspect that was more due to my overfilling, as that resolved quickly once I started using it.

It doesn't seem to go bad, the last jar I had lasted me 4 years without souring or losing its pigment. Not alcohol based, so the finished product will have a long lifespan, as well.

The 2 oz bottle holds a generous amount of ink, and its vibrant yellow color stands out for its striking opacity and smooth flow. This makes it perfect for everything from calligraphy and lettering to illustrations and fine art projects. One of the key highlights of this ink is its fluidity. It glides effortlessly on various surfaces, from traditional calligraphy paper to heavier mixed media paper, offering consistent, clean lines without clogging dip pens or brushes. The Primrose Yellow shade is lively, providing a sunny, vivid pop of color that holds its brightness even after drying. It dries to a smooth, satin finish and remains fade-resistant, keeping your artwork fresh and vibrant. The ink's rich pigmentation means that it works well on both light and dark surfaces, and it can also be mixed with other colors from the Speedball range for custom hues. It's highly versatile, making it ideal for calligraphy and adding decorative touches to cards, journals, and more. One minor drawback is that, like many lighter inks, Primrose Yellow may require a couple of layers on darker backgrounds to achieve full opacity. However, its buildable nature makes it easy to control the level of intensity. Overall, Speedball's Calligraphy Ink in Primrose Yellow is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to add vivid, high-quality ink to their creative toolkit. Its brightness, fluidity, and versatility make it a standout option for seasoned calligraphers and beginners.",

There will be some separation that occurs, so you have to be sure to mix the ink prior to using - a long toothpick usually works best for this. If not mixed before applying, the ink will dry down with a slight yellow tint to it, and if over darker colors will not be as opaque. One small downside is that the ink easily \"beads up\" on the applicator during use, especially if you've shaken or even turned the bottle to mix the ink. Even if you wipe the excess off the bristles on the rim of the bottle, you have to keep an eye out for extra product that will bead up higher on the wand. These beads of ink will roll down the applicator and brush pretty quickly as you're using it, if you don't watch out. Overall the product is good, and I will continue to repurchase. #sweepstakes",

I'm gonna use it to the last drop like I usually do when I test inks, but so far amazing, of course not every ink is the same, I encourage to do a lot of research before buying white inks because they all have different factors, like opacity, the ability to draw over it again and not get a weird blue line or it to be stiff and rough, the viscosity level (I prefer very high), and much more! I think the only thing that might come close to this quality of ink is maybe Copic opaque white, though remember that the copic is a higher price and still in my opinion is not as good. Other then that I think there is very little competition.",

Because it is liquid, it can be used in wet-on-wet washes at full strength, where it provides beautiful watery textures without noticeable granulation and few blooms. At full strength it dries with a sheen and the paint layer has a perceptible thickness sitting on top of the paper, which can make it stand out in a watercolor painting, so be aware of that.",

      "review_title": "Worth Adjusting To",
      "review_desc": "I love using Higgins ink in all of my illustrations. I won't deny it. Using this ink rather than a watercolor paint gives a certain vibrancy you cannot achieve using another medium. Majority of the colors will say \"non-waterproof,\" but when working with it, you will find that if you find yourself spilling water on a completed piece, majority of the colors act as though they were \"waterproof.\" Out of my experiences with Black India, Russet, Red-Orange, Red, Violet, Blue, \"Green\", Turquoise, and Leaf-Green... The only colors which have proven themselves to move when re-dampened have been Blue and \"Green.\" On this note, WARNING: INK, especially INDIA INK will NOT come out of clothing! Now, the reason I put \"Green\" in quotation marks is because \"Green\" is far closer to a blue hue than any type of green... In fact, I typically use it when painting skies. You have got to be weary when choosing colors, the color you may think you want could end up looking entirely different. Use scrap paper when painting, see what it looks like dried before using it, too. Another thing about using these inks is how they blend. If you're new to the medium, it will shock you: Once the ink has dried on the paper, there is little to no chance of moving it. If you want a gradient, you must add it before it dries. This is both a blessing and a curse. If you let the ink dry before evening out the paint, you are left with a crisp line where the water's edge was, but if you plan on it drying, you are guaranteed layers which will not become muddy the more layers you add. Colors will blend with each other if you mix them while wet or on your palette, but if you allow the paint to dry before you add an extra color the DEPTH you achieve is far greater than if you were to attempt the same thing in any other medium. You can show distinct violets and distinct greens right to each other without becoming too muddy if you desire, you can't get that too easily with other mediums. It may also seem like you're buying a tiny bottle of ink, but just a few drops will go a long way. I started using Ink as my primary medium 6 months ago, and only recently have I started to begin replacing bottles. Higgins ink, like all art mediums alike, takes some getting used to. If you want to achieve high-intensity colors, Higgins ink is a good place to find it. If you are looking for a new challenge, I would highly recommend Higgins Ink. As the inks are mainly permanent and highly concentrated, do not buy for younger artists. Watercolors are great for kids, but if you're looking for something new to try, look into \"gouache.\" Happy Creating!",

The size of these brushes (handle, overall diameter and belly) are larger than the All Purpose brushes with the same numbering system. This makes it much easier for me to hold multiple brushes in one hand. But the size difference is something to be aware of if you prefer to work with smaller brushes. Hair does fall out. At this price point that is to be expected. The best way to help with shedding is to properly remove starch when they arrive, inspect and then carefully remove the loose hair. Gently swirl the brush in the cup of your hand under cold, running water while cleaning. Lightly wipe on a lint free cloth to remove excess water. Avoid squeezing or pinching to remove water. Shape and hang to dry. Before any session I fan the dry bristles with my fingers to see if there are any loose hairs. I've had very little to no shedding with the 6 brushes I own. I've used them multiple times a day for two weeks. These brushes hold a nice amount of ink and surfactant. They also keep their shape after I've curved the bristles to change the angle of the toe. I would recommend these brushes over the marbling kit brushes. Half of those have lost many bristles even after gentle care.",

It is a sheep hair which answers the question of why it is a bit stiffer than my Holbein Hake series 1220 with goat bristles I think it is a very good brush for the money and otherwise. Some peoples reviews said it was cheaply made. Not at all. It is not a fancy original hake brush finish, sawn etc., but it does not look or feel cheap just because of metal holding the hair. I would describe it to be a simple brush and very inexpensive. I do recommend it because it does apply washes well, not stiff but a bit stiffer hair than goat hair. I already tested it. Nice short handle. And unlike Holbein Hake 1\" series 1220 brush, this one four times less expensive. Go for it, you will like it. Also great to smooth a wash.

This box actually has a layer of White with Gold and Silver Speckle on top of the standard, plain White, and both are made more translucent with the Mod Podge application. I've never tried making prints with this, but it comes in handy for lots of different projects: like glued onto Grafix Wet Media Clear Film to make fairy wings (the Wet Media because PVA will adhere much better than to untreated plastic). I may try some prints soon too. I love the way art materials make you want to make things!",

I'm absolutely addicted to paper- I love having different patterns, colors, textures, etc. to draw, write, and embellish with. Most of the paper is definitely usable for me. Unfortunately, it seems like a lot of school items were tossed in and quite frankly, a waste of space for what I would need. Paper dolls, odd prints that look like classroom bulletin board decorations (on a glossy photo-like paper?), paper quilt stencils, and some odd craft kits were pretty much useless to me, moreso than the quilling paper. Overall, I am able to use 7 or so pounds of the paper package. So, not a bad deal for the price. The others, I can easily give to other artists in the many supply trades I participate in.",

I use them in still lifes when they are large sheets, but also eventually cut them up to use in mixed-media works. Be aware that FYI, the dye lots can vary over time. I bought this coffee bean pattern again in orange -- gorgeous! -- several months after my first purchase. The Omaha Blick store no longer carried it but it's my favorite to use in various artworks. The one that arrived by mail is a lighter orange, but still very pretty and the pattern is oriented in the vertical position; the original one was in horizontal orientation. These are a great buy for very little money and the $3 shipping fee is worth it; Blick expertly packages the paper flat -- and you get a lot of useful cardboard for storing papers, etc. #sweepstakes",

The paper will curve a little with a lot of wet media, but I've had no problem flattening it by wetting the back and pressing it afterwards.

I wish I'd gone with the fine tip for drawing though. It's hard to get fine lines from it.

At least, I didn't think I was until I tried this brand as compared to the cruddy dimestore gel pens I'd made the mistake of buying in my fledgling days of gel pen work. This brand however has completely changed my mind about the viability of the medium. I was skeptical at first, when lots of other folks I'd talked to had recommended the brand to me, so I bought one of their smaller sets to start out and shortly fell in love with them. They have a great selection of colors, write smoothly (most of the time), offer a great variety of finishes / effects (metallic, sparkle, opaque, opaque neon, and colors intended to write best on black papers), and last a very long time! A few pens in my collection are several years old and still work perfectly fine despite being left sitting around in a drawer. They may be a bit expensive on the surface, but the price is very much worth it. Trust me. You won't be tossing out these gel pens like you'd toss out the cheaper ones.

The line will also just get thicker the longer you have the pen. When they work right though they're great. You do need to wait a bit before coloring on top of these pens because they will bleed/smudge. I usually wait at least 5-10 minutes.

I buy sparkle gel pens to write notes with for both class and school and these are the best. The colors are really vibrant, and the black is rich and not watery. The inks flow very well and the sparkles are a really nice effect, I have pain in my hands and writing with gel pens helps as they flow better than normal ballpoint pens, but I'm also a 90's kid at heart so I needed plenty of colors and sparkles! I've left the lid off of one of these pens for 8 days before and it didn't dry out (the red), and have accidentally done the same overnight multiple times leaving my desk and forgetting to recap. Never dries out. Out of the 7 sets I've gone through, only 2 pens have ever been \"defective\" with air bubbles in the ink. The only other \"downside\" is that the \"scent\" is faint, but you can smell grapes with the purple, for example, it's just really faint while you write. The pack also makes a great gift for birthdays and holidays, so I've not only gotten packs for friends who have enjoyed them but it's a constant stocking stuffer for myself every holiday. Seriously, these gel pens ROCK The pens last forever, too, I just use them daily for multiple hours so I run through them really fast.",

Anyway, a few years back I suffered a stroke which somewhat curtailed my model hobby that started again after I retired. So these past four years I got back into coloring books. Not all the time mind you but just to break the boredom. Then this past month I purchased some adult based coloring books for markers, and that got me to thinking about these markers I had down in my studio cabinet. Lo and behold, they are still quite functional, but I have a few that after reopening the caps, they start to dry out until I put the cap back on and let it rest for a day or two. I think a new set is in the future. Yet, after almost 40 years, I can't complain about a very good purchase.",

Then a few days later i got an email saying they couldn't cover the shipping cost. I feel like this was a bait-and-switch. I already was expecting shipping so i payed the EXTRA $ just to get them shipped. That didn't leave me with a great feeling about ordering from your website ever again. I live in Hawaii, USA. If you do not include Alaska and Hawaii in your free shipping offer then you should change your website to specifically say \"Free shipping in the continental United states.

The dual tip connection feature is a great idea as well as being able to order handles, connectors and fills.

I really appreciate not having to regularly pump the pen like I have to with my paint pens, and also there are no sudden puddles of pigment on the paper! Excellent! Now, unlike my paint pens, these pens often require multiple coats to get a good, saturated color. Perhaps this is due to drawing on black paper? I will try a white paper next. I do see individual lines being laid down, though that adds a nice visual texture. I would like to see options for additional colors and marker tips. I would buy a fine point set in a heartbeat! So, Sharpie has a great idea. Now, it's time to expand both the color line and choice of marker tip.",

      "review_title": "Great... with caveats.",
      "review_desc": "I typically use Uni Posca paint markers and tried these because I wanted to add more colors to my collection and liked the idea of the brush tip. Pros: the ink comes out right away and is quickly opaque - they don't have to be shaken nearly as long as Posca's and you don't have to 'pump' the tip to use them (this means no puddles of ink sudden spurting out when pushing on the tip). The brush tip is nice for certain applications and seems durable. The color choices are nice and I appreciate having more earthy/nature colored choices than with some of the other brands. Cons: The brush tip is quite soft and getting a fine line is much more of a challenge and requires a very light touch. Some of the colors don't do well (smearing) when varnishing over them (the same holds true for a few of the Posca colors, but was worse with these). I typically use Posca paint markers for painting very detailed/fine lined holiday ornaments on both smooth and rounded surfaces. I also use them for decorating cardboard boxes/mailers I send out. The Karin markers excel at painting on cardboard (more instantly opaque for most of them), but they're trickier for doing fine line work. I probably won't be purchasing more because of the varnish issue and troubles getting a very fine line, but I would recommend them if those are things that you don't care about. They would be fabulous for sketch book use, calligraphy, etc.!",

CONS: Tip is so soft (which can be good if you do use them like brushes, but you won't get the sharp lines like a Posca). Too easy to color transfer, be careful of staining your light colors. Pens can get clogged - I have to remove the tip and then shove in a straightened paperclip to clear the blockage. Shaking doesn't really replenish the ink in the tip. Would I buy again? I am not sure. Maybe if they were on a really fantastic sale.",

I tend to work abstractly\u2026these are great for making a variety of marks and filling in larger areas with color. They're easier to use than watercolor for sketching purposes, but they don't behave exactly the same as watercolors. Still lots of fun to play with, and it's interesting to see how water droplets, alcohol, and other things affect them in my sketchbook. Truly wonderful product! I love that I don't have to throw them away and can easily refill them. When I hit the road for a sketching trip, I take along plastic 1 ounce squeeze bottles (purchased elsewhere) filled with ink for each marker so that I can refill them as needed.

      "review_desc": "I'm a dedicated watercolor illustrator, but when I tried professional colored pencils and found out they're a lot better than the cheap ones I swore off as a kid, I had to know if markers were the same. They are. I imagine Sakura Koi is not exactly pro grade since the description says it's not lightfast, but it's definitely better than what I was given growing up. The ink stays wet long enough that you can cover a decent area (though not very large) and get a smooth color laydown with no messy overlap lines. I do recommend you get paper that's specifically made for markers, as it will make a world of difference in your tone, color, and feathery-finesse lines. I also recommend watching some professional demos online to get out of the childhood mindset of \"just fill every area in with solid, flat color\", and move on to something more like: \"let every stroke of the pen be like a stroke with the paintbrush--a living, speaking, textured breath\". It sounds corny, but it's great to use them for what they're designed to do well, rather than still coloring like a child, because it ends up being very motivating when you can see an amazing unity of artist and material in the finished work. (As an aside, I think some of the colors are named a bit oddly, so definitely make your own color chart on a piece of marker paper rather than the underside of the cardboard insert like what comes in the set of 48 so you can get the real color in your head. I tried their cardboard color chart panel and the colors didn't come out true on it because of the texture of the material.)",

I'm now hooked on watercolor, but I feel the most comfortable with the marker style and there aren't as many options in that style. I've tried other more expensive markers like the faber-castell and they are just a different experience (brush tip on the art pop is a nice feature.) the faber have a richer color but to me they feel slower in the way the color mixes with the water so your effect might change slightly after a couple minutes. I could be wrong my experience is rather limited. My wife got me into artist trading cards so I've included a few examples. These Art Pop markers are definitely worth a shot.",

Very easy to fill once you get the hang of it. The directions for filling are not clear, however. The squeeze button to release more water is great, and allows you to regulate better the amount of wetness you get. I have used other name-brand water brushes (Kuretake and Pentel) that also worked very well initially. For some reason, all 4 of those brushes started being very difficult to get any water at all to come out of them. I don't know why this would be the case. I only filled them with pure water. In any event, hopefully the Caran d'Aches water brushes will not have this issue. If they hold up, I would give them 5 stars.",

It is double secured because we know that they like to sneak out of the bottle and go everywhere But, using this waterbrush and just adding very little oms I am able to contain the vapors and not have it spill out in my bag. I have used many over the years and just gently touch it to my colored pencil work. It removes the wax glare and shine and loosens up the oil paint inside truly confusing the onlooker. As a watercolorist the inability to let the paint in the pencils get into the crevices off the surface of whether it be hp paper , cp, Pastelmat or sanded paper frustrated me so I 100% recommend this to \" keep it contained\" and love what one draws.",

      "review_desc": "I use the Gold pen with the Chisel Tip on top of my acrylic paintings. Only requires 1 layer and is opaque, completely covering up any acrylic color underneath it. The paint flows thickly and smoothly out of the pen and the end result is a gorgeous, incredibly bright gold. This is the best metallic paint pen I've come across. Superior to posca pens. It has a pretty strong odor, so use in a well ventilated area. I'm sharing a recent piece of work using the gold paint pen in places where I would normally apply metallic embossing powder. #sweepstakes",

I've never seen anyone use these except those who got theirs the same way I did. I love to try new art products. If the white works out well, I will be back to review again. Ive had this marker for over a month and it still works great. But it is a specific use and I dont use it often. It is not like an alcohol based blendable colors copic. It is great for posters. It is great for its unbeatable opaque covering properties. I use it in my visual journal. I dont know how the fine size works. This review is based on the medium.",

The only problem that I have is that the bigger sizes are felt tipped. It's hard to get the amount of line variation in one stroke without rolling the pen onto it's side, and that changes the shape of the line. The medium nib is useless as an in between because the bold tip reaches the same amount of finer lines as it does. The fine nib is by far my favorite despite also being a felt tip. It has the widest range of fine to thick, and if you need to make those lines even thicker it's easy to go over a portion with the bold nib and have it blend smoothly into a thicker line. I'm fairly heavy handed so the fine nib is taking quite the beating and isnt breaking down too quickly. Overall, not bad, but i wouldnt buy them as a set again. i'd just get the fine nib.",

      "review_desc": "The fine (FB) Sakura Pigma pens are not as sensuously smooth as the slightly less expensive Pigma brush markers, but they are ultimately more of a pleasure to use precisely because of their resistance: you must apply appreciable pressure to get a thicker line, so you can FEEL what line you are producing; they provide haptic feedback. At the lightest pressure, you get close to a 0.5 mm line with a subtle nuance in width. Heavier pressure will go fatter than 1 mm. Gestural marks made with these pens look exquisitely expressive. Do the same with a multiliner and you'll get scribble (these are better for finely controlled hatching); do the same with a Pigma brush marker and you'll get a nice result, but more erratic, less subtle than you can make with the FB pen. If you make lots of thick lines, the Pigma FB pens start losing their juice fairly quickly--but don't throw them out; stored head down they'll regain their flow for a time longer. I'm experimenting with keeping the spent ones till they're fully dry for use in making feathery strokes. As for the price, they're not cheap, but nor are they likely to be cheap to manufacture, and I know of absolutely nothing that can compare with them.",

The consistency of the paints are nice to work with. On velour, colors can be a little blotchy if you overload your brush (\"splotches\" in water were not intentional in attached five-fish sample). This was me, not the paint, though -- second draft is looking much better. Also on second draft (not shown), colors blend well on velour.

I half expected some difficulty mixing colors, but it wasn't so - at room temperature, was simple to rub onto adjacent spots on palette and then mix with either knife or brush. Pleasant, creamy texture. Thin layer dried quickly enough to paint over in a couple of days without streaking. The only drawback is that the set didn't come with a white oil paint stick -- but that happened to be a Blick bonus at the time I bought, so thanks for that, Blick! Thanks also for the #sweepstakes whereby I might win some $ to buy a few more R+F oil paint sticks.",

When painting, I use regular linseed oil or oil painting medium and the finished painting looks the same as traditional oil paints. I do not dip my brush into water as I'm painting. They dry faster than traditional oil paint on both the canvas and pallet so to keep the paint moist for the next day I simply place Saran Wrap lightly over my pallet and run my finger around each color to create a barrier. Works great! Depending on how thick you apply your paint will determine how tacky or wet your canvas will be the next day.",

They don't require painting oils or mediums that you would use for normal oil paints so for someone like me who paints in a small space with a kid running around, being able to paint with water without strong smells just made oil painting process more accessible. (Cleaning process is easier too) Initially I tried these out of necessity, but once I tried, I fell in love with their colors and how the colors blend. You can use them with water but they do have their own painting oil too. They are pricy side of paints, however if you like watercolor and wants try oil painting or like watercolor feel paintings, I think they are worth trying.",

It's the opaque, affordable, won't-bleed-through base for monochrome tonal sketches whether they're applied as a wash or as a grisaille, the natural earthy brown of rocks, tree trunks, many shadows, etc. Also great mixed with ivory black to create a good imitation of melanin that is found in most animals (including us). A speck of raw umber takes the saturation down in blues, greens, reds, and violets. Plays very well with ultramarine blue for cool grays. Warning to the new user: it dries darker than it looks when wet, and it keeps on darkening over time, so as soon as it's dry (which occurs quickly), \"oil it out\" with your favorite medium to get the true depth.",

The range of colors in this set is good and covers most needs - a wider range of colors is available as individual crayons. I purchased a set of these oil sticks 15 - 20 years ago, and over time they seemed to disintegrate in that they lost their workability and became a sticky messy headache. The drying time for those oil sticks was weeks to months, which made them impossible to work with. It will be interesting to see how this set behaves over time. Perhaps I need to use them faster!

I recommend a different brand for cobalt violet and I would consider a pale oil version of ultramarine (poppy or safflower) but many of the paints in the Grumbacher line are solid choices for many oil painters. Real cadmium yellow offers better opacity than anything other than bismuth yellow (which is only vivid in its lemon hue, unlike cadmiums which extend into the reds); opacity is generally important in oils.",

Sadly, due to poorly manufactured products, I am put in the position of finding another source of paint stick product. There is a difference in drying times from the older product, there is lack of density in the applied colors, and the hues do not match the older colors. The final dried surface does not resemble the texture nor flatness of the older product. Inconsistency of manufacture is a nail in the coffin of a product that is meant to be in existence forever. The owners of the Shiva product know that the lowering of standards on professional tools will put them out of business, maybe this is what they want, to gut the fine company for a few extra dollars. This a complaint about the entire Shiva line, not any one item, such as Cobalt Blue Hue, which costs the same as Cobalt Blue but is definitely not cobalt blue. This bait and switch is so transparent as to be laughable, what other humdingers are out there?",

It dissipates quickly. The incredible drying time is the winner for me. The paint is slightly less opaque than traditional oils, but a quick swish in mineral spirits cleans your brushes COMPLETELY with no effort. In virtually every regard, they perform the same as oils, and you can mix your traditional oils into alkyds with no problems (though the drying time will be extended by the traditional oils.) If you like the idea of oil paint that dries within a few hours or almost completely overnight, buy a limited palette of alkyds and go for it.

The regular price is already fair for the amount of paint you get, and the sale price makes it an even better deal\u20148 1/2 times the paint for less than 3 times the cost is fantastic. However, the consistency of this paint is a major drawback. It's impossibly thick\u2014so much so that squeezing it out of the tube requires significant effort. Once out, it takes even more work (and a lot of trial and error) to get it to a usable consistency. Thankfully, I've found that mixing it with Gamblin Solvent-Free Gel helps considerably, making it possible to work it into a smooth, paintable texture. Still, the extra effort is something to keep in mind. If you're willing to put in the time, this paint is a great value for the price, but the consistency may be frustrating for some users. #sweepstakes",

      "review_desc": "The book contains high quality hot press paper that is a bit rougher in texture and more absorbent than Arches hot press. The paper has no distracting textural pattern and works well for detailed, small watercolor and pen work, but the high absorbency of the paper makes for a bit of blooming on very fine, small scale line work. The paper doesn't easily pill and allows for smooth washes, layered glazes, and removal of non-staining watercolor mistakes through light scrubbing with a damp brush. Both sides of the paper may be drawn upon in watercolor with no bleed through and there is no real difference in texture between the sides of the sheets. There is a slight bit of buckling with heavier applications of wet in wet watercolor or washes, but nothing extreme. I really wish the cover weren't white and made out of absorbent fabric, but I understand that many people enjoy decorating them. If I had a choice, I'd rather a dark grey, brown, or olive green cover in a leatherette material (like a Moleskine). The cover is a minor complaint though. The book is well made, with a sewn binding, and folds flat for use. Until Arches makes a hot press, hardbound watercolor journal, or Stillman and Birn makes a hardbound book that is 100% cotton (but hot press and extra-heavy like their Zeta paper), this is what I'll buy and recommend to my students when there is a need for a hardbound watercolor book made from 100% cotton hot press paper.",

      "review_desc": "In the past month or so, I have been trying to wake up that long-dormant part of my brain that used to sketch and ink. In the way too many years since high school, my brain has gotten knocked around a bit (tip: do not walk into an open bomb bay door) and working on oil spills did some other types of damage. Result: can't draw a straight or curved line. By doing them over and over and over again, I hope to be able to do them better than I am able to now. So, deciding to use something other than my printer paper or office steno pads, I bought two of the Fabriano 1264 sketch pads, this 9\"x12\" pad and their 5.5 x8\" spiral bound pad. I have only used the 9\"x12\" so far, using it as my learning and practice pad. I ruled some lines on a couple of pages to make smaller spaces to do pencil and ink learning and sketching. I am also learning to use watercolor paint and pencils, so am taking the opportunity to do a little wet on dry in this book. Despite being 60 lb/80 gsm, the paper held up fine with the painting I did on it as well as a little bit of colored ink and a lot of black ink. The paper feels sturdy enough to not inadvertently rip the perforated pages out. The double-ring spiral binding doesn't snag pages and it is really easy to flip back and forth in the book. My goal is to fill these up and then get more of them. (Don't judge - I've just been doing this for less than a month) #sweepstakes",

The hard backing is very useful for sketching while sitting or outdoors, and the spiral binding means you can work the full page and lay it flat. Not many similar quality options like this. The ties are a bit of a pain and indent the first and last pages of the book, but I can see they'd be useful for collage or if you are carrying bits of paper within it or tossing it in a backpack and were worried about the corners getting dinked. 4 stars for quality, 2 for relative value, but if money is no object, it's a very nice sketchbook, and will serve certain uses well.",

It can handle quite a variety. Also sometimes for watercolor pencil with water brushed in. It even has enough tooth for a little graphite or soft pencil/charcoal. Also I prefer spiral bound sketchbooks for this type of sketching since they don't fall apart and can be opened flat for a 2 page spread if you want.

So far, I am impressed. The paper is thick enough to handle a variety of media. The paper is not watercolor paper and does not claim to be. However, if you are using a small watercolor field set, this paper works just fine. My Sharpie line drawings do well on the paper with no bleeding. Colored markers show up bright and crisp. I appreciate the hard cover for protecting the work inside. When researching sketchbooks, one of the key things I look for is how the sketchbook is bound. A spiral-bound one will lie flat for you as you work and close up \"good as new\" when you are done.",

The glossy softcovers of sketch pads leave those pages vulnerable to getting bashed about in my bag. These are glued edge pads of decent quality sketch paper, with a hardcover exterior. If ArtPop! had made this the core of their marketing for this product, or maybe put a sash around the books to keep pages from falling out, they'd probably have happier customers. As it is, the one star review sold me on these! I bought multiple packs. I would not hesitate to give these to artist friends, while explaining the quirk about them.

The problem was I had another class coming up and ended to do something. For a long time I had been wanting to switch to a minimal color palette, and this is was my opportunity to give it a try. I quickly ordered my three primary's, on being M. Graham Nickel Azo Yellow. Blick shipped my order quickly, and the creamy honey base that M. Graham puts in their watercolor makes it a great choice for my workshop students. There is less chance that their paints will be all dried out. M. Graham Nickel Azo Yellow is a very clean color. Used thicker and it acts like Quinacridone Gold, a great product for a #sweepstakes review, give it a try, you won't regret it!",

The paper doesn't pool, and paint can be lifted reasonably well. Colors remain vibrant and paint behaves well. I've used this for my students for years, and plan to continue doing so.",

I should have stuck with my regular student grade paper - Strathmore 400 series. The Fabriano Acquarello Artistico 100% cotton is a very superior and I prefer this over Arches 100% cotton.",

The generous 60 sheets is great as I never feel too precious about starting a new painting; whether it's for practice, studies, or something I intend to give away as a gift. The cotton content automatically elevates my painting experience compared to a cellulose based paper, and the texture (which is slightly more pronounced that some other cold pressed papers) is perfect for expressive landscapes and florals, which are my favorite subjects for watercolors. I would highly recommend this pad for any watercolor artist, whether you are just starting out or are deep into your practice.",

The spiral version is great to use as a watercolor sketchbook of sorts, but the pages don't have any perforation, so your only option is to rip or cut them out. The paper is still wonderful, so it's not a huge deal, but it is a little less convenient than the glue-bound pad.",

As far as watercolor goes, it's not high priced cotton, or even high end wood pulp paper. But, it's great for daily painting practice. The attached painting used wet-on-dry, wet-on-wet, lifting, and layering over dry paint multiple times. The paper curled slightly, but not so much that it interfered with painting. I painted it when I figured I had about 45 minutes before I'd be too sleepy to do any art. I would never have started a painting with my good cotton paper in that situation for fear of wasting it. This paper allows me to practice more frequently which in the long run is the most important way of improving my art. For the price and number of sheets, it might be 5 stars.",

      "review_desc": "I bought this to try as an inexpensive general purpose paper \u2013 initial composition and testing techniques in watercolor, pencil sketches, thumbnail value studies, art journal, etc. It's great for those uses and so much more. It makes an inexpensive plein air watercolor block if you glue all the sides with tacky glue. Is it like 300 lb cotton? No. Is it still useful for watercolor? Absolutely. You can lift, glaze, use masking fluid, and even do moderate, small areas of wet on wet with just little bit of buckling. It's not for finished watercolor painting, but it lets me get the basics right before attempting a piece on $7 a sheet cotton paper. Beyond watercolor, it works for finished pieces in colored pencil, oil pastel, charcoal, and graphite. But the best part for me is that it can be turned into wonderful sanded pastel paper with just one or two coats of clear gesso (Liquitex or W & N) or Golden pastel ground. Because it's meant for WC, it holds up to the wet application with just slight bending, and dries flat. My pastel painting has improved significantly with this inexpensive option, instead of struggling with pastel papers that have only minimal capacity for layering. I don't have the budget to buy prepared sanded papers, but I do have 10 minutes to turn Vision WC paper into sanded paper. It would be nice to have more options in the pad size, such as 11 x 14, and 12 x 16. Love being able to simplify by using one paper for a wide range of uses. It doesn't replace high end WC paper or specialty papers, such as laid charcoal paper, but it's a versatile, inexpensive paper with good weight. #sweepstakes",

      "review_desc": "As watercolor paper, this isn't cotton, and it's not the 400/500 series, so I didn't expect that type of performance. I wanted an inexpensive, decent quality WC pad for use in the field, for practice, and for studies prior to doing a final painting. This is perfect for those uses and exceeded my expectations for the very low price. In the quick study shown, I used wet on wet, lifting, and multiple layers of glazing over dry paint with no problems. I did a masking fluid test and the paper also handled that with no problems. I didn't stretch or even tape the paper down. There was of course some buckling when the paper was saturated, but it dried nice and flat. One downside - this is listed as 140 lb but seems thinner than other S'more 140 lb WC paper. It also has minimal tooth - more like hot press than cold press. On the other hand, its subtle texture makes it wonderful for many drawing media. On the page of doodles, I used wax-based CP, WC pencils, oil-based CP, watercolor and pen, graphite, charcoal, and oil pastel. All these media went on smoothly and easily. As needed, depending on the medium, I blended with stumps, lifted with a kneaded eraser, erased, added multiple layers over existing color, and burnished. Even oil pastel layered easily despite the minimal tooth. I have the Vision Mixed Media pad, and I like this much better for all the media I tested. I also have a variety of other dry media drawing pads. In the future, this will be my primary paper for dry media because it's the most versatile and economical, and performs as well or better than bristol, heavy drawing paper, charcoal paper, etc. I'll also continue to use this as a WC field pad, and for studies and practice. (I made a low-budget plein air block from one pad by gluing the three sides with tacky glue - but leave a gap for a palette knife to remove the sheets!) Almost forgot - both sides are equally usable - the back is a tad smoother than the front.",

I already own a fair number of brushes both synthetic and natural in a range of quality so I figured these would fit somewhere in the spectrum of what I already owned. I am happy to say I was wrong. These brushes are extraordinary. They soak up a massive amount of water but still remain stiff enough to allow the user a tremendous amount of control. My only negative observation is that they feel funny to the touch - rather coarse. Yes, I know, you're really not supposed to touch your brushes too much, but everyone does it. If I had based my decision to purchase them based on sensory perception rather than third party advice, I would not have bought them. But they are more than worthy of their extraordinary reputation.

This 7x10 size works well for me - it's a good size for a larger painting but can also be cut or divided into smaller sections. No doubt it is personal preference, but so far, this is my favorite paper, and I have tried Stonehenge, Arches, Baohong, and Winsor Newton. #sweepstakes",

Can take a beating, and does get warped but that is ok if you use tape. Amazing price for the amount of paper you get and feels really good to paint on. It does offer a slightly lighter watercolor wash than heavier papers but it layers very well and is easy to do effects with. It's become a top favorite for me and has surpassed my old budget favorite from grumbacher. This is a fun go to for an artist who isn't selling their work but wants bulk paper that won't break the bank. Between this and Richeson watercolor paper, I'd choose Richeson for the texture and price and it's sturdiness-but this is the stuff I'd happily give out to friends and students.

      "review_desc": "The book contains high quality hot press paper that is a bit rougher in texture and more absorbent than Arches hot press. The paper has no distracting textural pattern and works well for detailed, small watercolor and pen work, but the high absorbency of the paper makes for a bit of blooming on very fine, small scale line work. The paper doesn't easily pill and allows for smooth washes, layered glazes, and removal of non-staining watercolor mistakes through light scrubbing with a damp brush. Both sides of the paper may be drawn upon in watercolor with no bleed through and there is no real difference in texture between the sides of the sheets. There is a slight bit of buckling with heavier applications of wet in wet watercolor or washes, but nothing extreme. I really wish the cover weren't white and made out of absorbent fabric, but I understand that many people enjoy decorating them. If I had a choice, I'd rather a dark grey, brown, or olive green cover in a leatherette material (like a Moleskine). The cover is a minor complaint though. The book is well made, with a sewn binding, and folds flat for use. Until Arches makes a hot press, hardbound watercolor journal, or Stillman and Birn makes a hardbound book that is 100% cotton (but hot press and extra-heavy like their Zeta paper), this is what I'll buy and recommend to my students when there is a need for a hardbound watercolor book made from 100% cotton hot press paper.",

The other thing that happened to me while working on an urban landscape, I worked an area a little longer than normal, and the paper started to shred! I was not scrubbing. I have worked with Fabriano before, and don't remember these problems. Unfortunately, I bought two packs of 5 full sheets, so it's a lot of paper to go through knowing I'll need to face these problems.

First removing the paper from the block was so difficult even very carefully using an exact blade that I eventually took all the binding off the block creating individual sheets and losing the benefit of a block which is better than trying to remove a painting and getting a torn painting. The worst problem with this paper (140 lb. Cold press) is that you can not use ANY type of tape or masking fluid on it. The tape lifts the nap and leaves a mark on your finished piece. I tested with this paper, Fabriano, Arches and Blick papers using three different kinds of tape on each paper and none of the papers besides Fluid from Speedball behaved this way. I contacted Speedball, sent them photos and a copy of my husband's receipt and heard nothing back from them. I gave them two stars because other than these two issues it performed fine. These were deal breakers for me to use as watercolor paper, I can use it as collage paper or if I don't plan to mask or tape.",

It's too wet to wedge to help, but I shouldn't have to leave a brand new bag of clay out to dry for me to make it usable. It's truly as if I got a bag of someone's poorly reclaimed clay.

When you place your newly thrown piece in a bag to dry, the bag scratches the soft wet clay very easily, though you can fix minor imperfections with a sponge later when you trim (as long as you're very careful not to let the edge of the bag dig too deep in the wet clay). When the clay that smudges on the bags dries, it is flaky and gets on your wet clay or drying product, which may or may not be easily wiped away, depending on how wet your product is when you get the dry flakes on it. It feels nice in the hands and works well on the wheel, minus the fact that it creates a ton of slip (I won't have to buy slip because I've been collecting the excess clay from my fingers and palms). I don't want to discourage you from buying this clay because it is something you can work with, but be aware of the challenges listed above.

The speckles don't develop until cone 5/6 and the color will become more of a rich yellow- tan vs orange so don't let the bisque fool you. In terms of glaze/ clay fit: I had good results with Mayco S & C, Duncan Concepts and most Mayco Fundamental underglazes, except Orange sorbet (UG 85) and pink pink (UG 146) which did eggshell. I also found the Amaco PC colors to be a little muddy on this clay so I now put a coat of white underglaze to help with that. I also suggest mixing Laguna Speckled Buff 50/50 with cone 5/6 B-mix if you want to lighten the color or lower the number speckles.",

It felt so different from stoneware, terracotta, etc. It is a porcelain, which is in its white form very different from other clay bodies in that you have to work with it just shy of being too dry. Too wet and it becomes slimy and impossible to control. Once I decided to treat it just like other porcelain, it was not only easy to work with, but quite wonderful. I was impressed with how neat and tidy the process was. Here is a clay that can be worked with in smaller studios, or even at home on a kitchen table! I hand built a sphere using the whole 11 pounds. I will be carving the surface when it reaches the next stage in stiffness. Once it is fired I will share some images.",

I've found that it's best to quickly smooth it on right after mixing, let it harden for about 30-45 minutes, then shape with tools until about the 2.5 hour mark with a barrier of plastic wrap on top to avoid getting the clay on your tools.

However, sometimes Part A can need softening. Aves recommends that you remove the lid and place the container in the microwave for 15 seconds (you can repeat this 15 seconds if needed). Remove with caution. Allow the product to cool completely before handling or mixing with part B (heat accelerates working time so allow it to cool before mixing). Do not heat Part B.

It's important that the clay not be overworked, and it must dry slowly. We do offer other types of air-dry clays which, although they cannot be fired, are more user-friendly and resistant to cracking. Please know that our Product Specialists are available to discuss these other options, or to offer tips on using the Magic Mud to its best advantage.

DON'T buy the ladoll premier, it seems better at first, but if you sand it, you can see the marks. if you wet it, it leaves dimensional drips and you lose the detail in a soapy mess. and it is very hard to paint. Blick on-line is now the only place i know of to get the ladoll clay, for some reason everyplace else has stopped carrying it, but still carries the wretched (and more expensive) ladoll.",

The clay version acts a little more like polymer clay as far as consistency, where the original Apoxie Sculpt is a bit more rubbery as you work with it. Not a major difference, but I've come to prefer the clay variety. Easy to use, no mess. Great product!",

We added food coloring to some of the clay and made nice marbled colors which was a nice alternative to painting after drying. The biggest drawback on this material is the small size packaging.

So many different clays out there, especially within brands which is very annoying-- but here finally landed on it. It's the one. I also really like that the instructions are really true. So many times with products, there's fudging of the manufacturer's instructions you have to do to get it right, but with this, you really do exactly what it says and it's all smooth sailing. The finished product is weighty. For my work, I'm going for that, weight is a plus. If you want feather light, Activa La Doll Premier Air-Dry is your guy.

I contacted customer service and after apologizing for the damaged product immediately began the process of completing the return and resending a new order. Unfortunately, when that package arrived it appeared to be packaged quite well until I checked the item. One of the three bottles was leaking. I contacted customer service and went through the same process. I explained that in the case of the packaging even though the box size was appropriate and there was bubble wrapping it was not around the item and the side of the leaking bottle was on a side without the protection of the bubble wrap. I suggested to tell the packaging employees to actually wrap the item with the bubble wrap and place it in an appropriate size box. My replacement item was well packed as I had suggested and other items I have received have been packaged quite well. I later discovered that the leaking bottles were cracked under the lids. Only issue I have with the clear product even tough it definitely has to be stirred well is that it remains quite thick and I've had to use a considerable amount of liquid clay thinner to get it to a workable consistency but it's still not an ideal consistency…but I will continue to stir, add thinner and use it.",

Many of us in the field had been using regular Super Sculpey for years to create toy prototypes and design maquettes for motion picture special effects, but were dissatisfied with its working properties. Super Sculpey Gray Medium hits the Goldilocks Zone in the world of polymer modelling materials. One of its best qualities is its neutral gray color and opacity, which allows surface finish and details to show clearly before the piece is baked hard. Also, the firmness is just right to hold good detail while having enough flow to capture fleeting gestures. #sweepstakes",

Since it's already soft you don't have to spend any time prepping it like the harder Sculpey and the much, much harder Fimo. One thing to note; the warmer the environment and the more you handle it the more malleable it can get. So if you need to work on your piece a lot or create a large item that needs to hold a rigid shape, this may not be the clay for you. I love the fact that I don't have to prep this - you can just open the package and start creating! It also bakes up nicely without the funky toxic-like smell that comes from Fimo. And it comes out as a super light-weight piece. It takes stains and paints beautifully too.",

Gotta teach kids how to wash their hands after working with clay. The oil from the clay makes the hands very slippery and just spreads over the hand - it's best when you clean with just paper towel and soap first, and then wash the soap off with water. But that is just how oil clay works. Mixing new colors is very fun too! #sweepstakes",

They do flow during firing and perform best when the inside of the piece is unglazed to allow the necessary off-gassing. We always encourage ceramicists to fire test tiles with their specific application, clay body, kiln environment and firing schedule to determine how to get the best results. If you would like suggestions on how to improve your results, we hope you'll feel welcome to reach out to our Product Information Team.

Please keep in mind that all of the labels for the Speedball Mid-Fire labels are pictures of the glazes fired to Cone 6 on a white stoneware clay. As the opacity of any glaze shifts throughout the surface of a piece, the color of clay often has an effect on the results. We suggest trying it on a white stoneware without speckles to achieve the results you see on the labels. For more information on the characteristics of each glaze, please feel free to reference the Resources Tab on our website.",

Based on the images you provided, it appears that either the glaze did not quite make it to minimum temperature in the kiln, or the glaze was not applied thick enough. An extended cooling cycle can also affect the results of the Speedball Mid-Fire glazes as well causing some of them to go matte in appearance. Tips for applying and firing this glaze can be found in the Resources Tab on our site. We hope this helps with your troubleshooting and future results, but if we can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to email info@dickblick.com or call 1-800-933-2542.",

Mayco's Designer Liners are similar to a translucent underglaze and are best used under non-moving transparent or semi-transparent glazes. They are formulated to mature at cone 06/05 and do work on top of a low-fire, non-moving glaze for design work. Most will maintain their color at higher temperatures, and they're tested for mid-range results, but any time you're combining different products and different brands, especially if you're firing hotter as you would be with Celadons, it's important to fire test tiles to determine what the outcome will be before applying to finished ware.

Once you put the piece into the reduction bin, which should be well-sealed and not too large to minimize oxygen, allow the piece to cool in the reduction bin for at least 20 minutes. Keep in mind that different organic materials may produce very different results, and make sure pieces are cleaned immediately to set the colors more permanently.

I tested them at cone 06 (witness cone was kissing the shelf), but I don't think 06 allows the glaze to mature enough for functional ware use ( 06 results would be cool for sculpture use though!). At low-fire, the results resemble under-fired glaze, not so much a true matte finish. Personally, I would not recommend this as a low fire glaze. However, I do think they are fantastic as a mid-range glazes! Both the black and white fired nice and glossy at cone 6! I was very pleased with the application and consistency of the glazes. 3 brushed coats provided a wonderful even coverage. I will use these at cone 6 :) Blick provided product for free to try and review.",

It was the perfect tool to help them create clean designs—they applied it to areas they wanted to keep glaze-free, and it worked beautifully. The wax dried quickly and resisted the school-colored glazes exactly as expected, allowing crisp lines and clean finishes on each piece. It was especially helpful for keeping the bottoms of the holders glaze-free for kiln firing. Easy to use, classroom-friendly, and effective—this wax resist made the glazing process smoother and more precise for all skill levels.",

      "review_desc": "These looms are quite sturdy, made of stout chipboard. I warp them with crochet cotton, and leave a little loop on the back when going from one slot to the next. I do this for two reasons; 1. It gives you the ability to loosen a warp thread if a student weaves with bulky materials that tighten the warp. 2. When weaving is finished, you can easily snip the loops to take the piece off the loom, and use the loom again. Before warping the first time, I go along and make sure all the slots are open all the way to the top; sometimes the sections between slots are attached right at the top, and this makes warping easier. I have students start by weaving two folded strips of paper in before they start their weaving, as spacers so when the warp is cut off the loom at the end, there are tails of warp that can be tied together to make fringe, or woven back up into the work to make a secure end. If you were to start weaving right at the end of the loom (which is what the picture here shows,) how would you remove it from the loom and secure the ends?",

I also didn't want to have to buy numerous after market parts so I like that one makes their own (reusable) string heddles giving great control over desired epi. Also the loom has the option of 4 sheds, adding more versatility should I want to experiment with other types of weaving. All in all I have been very happy with this purchase.",

About 15 years ago, I'd ordered a set of Schacht School Looms from Blick for an afterschool program for kids in grades K-12, and the looms held up remarkably well, even under daily and not always gentle use. Before purchasing one for myself, I checked out some other tapestry looms on the market, but kept coming back to the Schact. Craftsmanship is excellent, and it was really easy to assemble. Although users will be limited by the size, it's a spot-on piece of weaving equipment for making small tapestries, bags, and even pillows; larger projects will involve sewing the pieces together. As a textile design major with a specialization in weaving, I highly recommend this loom!",

I looked around at looms of various constructions and sizes, and this Schacht School Loom fit the bill of what I most wanted. The price was very reasonable, my order from Blick arrived soon after I made the purchase, everything was just as described, assembly was very easy, and I was right on my way to weaving. I love working with the loom and look forward to it every day. The fact that it has legs that enable the loom to stand up on a surface means it's stable and not flopping around in your lap or on a table. It also feels like it could last a lifetime. I love it!",

And my crochet projects are going to be super cool for the gifts I'm making. Would recommend for teachers and anyone who works in costuming/set design. This stuff is amazing and creative!",

Save the specialty stitches for other thinner yarns. You can try them with this chunky yarn, but they won't show the way you think they will.

My Addi works great with it. Tip: Every skein or two, rub down the machine with a cloth with a little squirt of food grade silicone spray on it to reduce static build-up that can cause split or dropped stitches. We like the 20% wool in the hope that it will help add some warmth when the weather is wet. The recipients really like their beanies. We wish that Blick would carry a chocolate brown, as the umber is too pale for our purposes. Our recipients currently like choosing among black, nightshade, forest heather, flint, and tawny port, and would love to have chocolate brown too.

The yarn is roving, so it does tend to go thick and thin but the project does come out very well because of the quality of the yarn. I would rate this about the same as Unforgettable or similar - it is about that thickness and that saturation of color. On the thin parts I have not had it separate at all, it is strong and spun well. I would recommend this highly. I bought the Agate for a project I am doing for a friend but will buy some for a blanket for myself. This is soft and has a wonderful hand. (Pic is the start of my project)",
