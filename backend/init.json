The stretcher bars are reinforced with cross bars, very sturdy, hefty, and square. The canvas was a bit loose in one corner, (which is to be expected with changes in temperature during shipping), but I had no problem straightening it out, tight as a drum, when I applied the keys to the bars in the back. The linen is a nice medium texture. Excellent quality for a good price."

Changes in humidity can cause the canvas to slacken at any time, so a canvas that's well-stretched by the manufacturer may be taut in our warehouse and looser when it arrives to you.

Mine are 24 x 30 inches and have one crossbar for support. Adequate extra canvas should you need to restretch. Corner folds good not great. Stretch is quite tight. Plenty of staples. Canvas looks to me like Fredrix Yankee, good tooth, fairly heavy, and though only 2 coats of gesso I've not noticed any bleed-through even with pours. Comes with wooden keys for the corners but some are too thick for the slots, the only knock. You could do a little better on some of these points but you'd pay 75% more."

It comes already primed which made it easy to get started. It's a bit heavier weight cloth than regular canvas, but I actually liked that better, since I am using a mix of regular acrylic, heavy body acrylic, and some other media on this piece. Unfortunately due to a health issue I have not been able to work on the piece much to show any photos ( it is also going to be a surprise gift). Liquitex has made a great product, one that I will be using exclusively from now on.

      "review_desc": "I'm not a huge fan of Winsor & Newton, especially since they've been bought out by the ColArt Group. But I have to admit, their stretched cotton canvas is the best you can get. If you want better quality than this, you'll be stretching your own. My biggest problem with pre-stretched canvas has always been canvas tightness. I like my canvas nice and tight. I don't want it wiggling around while I'm trying to paint. This canvas is relatively tight right out of the package. And it comes with these cool adjustable wedges. These wedges take it to the next level. So if you work on cotton canvas, and you prefer to buy pre-stretched, I highly recommend that you give this product a try."

Little bit wrinkly on glued edge and the disc had a flat part like they couldn't quite cut a perfectly round pressed wood disc. I think framing might solve the aesthetic wobble. Will keep because it is too cheap to return & it's so tiny it's not worth the carbon footprint a return would entail. Fredrix is my go to canvas. Normally they provide perfect canvases.

However, fine linens often have an open weave where light can shine through the priming. In addition, in fine weaves it's not unusual for the priming to penetrate and show white spots on the back of the fabric, but since the canvas has been sized (and the sizing is clear), there is no harm to the linen fibers. Both characteristics are sometimes mistaken for pinholes, but they are not holes and not flaws. Nonetheless, we welcome you to return any item that does not meet your expectations.

      "review_desc": "We’re sorry to hear that your experience with this canvas has been an unhappy one. Changes in humidity can cause the canvas to slacken, and you can tighten the canvas using the corner keys that are pre-installed in the stretcher frame for this purpose. If the wood frame is warped, the best place to start is by removing any tensioning keys you’ve inserted and move the canvases away from any source of humidity. The frame may straighten if some stress that's causing it to bow can be removed, but it’s not uncommon with warped canvases that the canvas fabric must be removed and put on new stretcher bars. Our Product Information Team is more than happy to assist with the materials and techniques you would need. Product Specialists are available weekdays from 8am to 5:30pm CST at 1-800-933-2542 or info@dickblick.com, and they're happy to help!"

Anyway, a few years back I suffered a stroke which somewhat curtailed my model hobby that started again after I retired. So these past four years I got back into coloring books. Not all the time mind you but just to break the boredom. Then this past month I purchased some adult based coloring books for markers, and that got me to thinking about these markers I had down in my studio cabinet. Lo and behold, they are still quite functional, but I have a few that after reopening the caps, they start to dry out until I put the cap back on and let it rest for a day or two. I think a new set is in the future. Yet, after almost 40 years, I can't complain about a very good purchase."

My only issue is when i bought them from DickBlick.com is that the price originally said free shipping on purchases over a dollar amount that i definitely exceeded with a 72 color Copic marker purchase. Then a few days later i got an email saying they couldn't cover the shipping cost. I feel like this was a bait-and-switch. I already was expecting shipping so i payed the EXTRA $ just to get them shipped. That didn't leave me with a great feeling about ordering from your website ever again. I live in Hawaii, USA. If you do not include Alaska and Hawaii in your free shipping offer then you should change your website to specifically say \"Free shipping in the continental United states. Does not include Alaska and Hawaii.\" Aloha, Tammi"

I didn't know when I bought them that they had replacement cartridges, it's a great idea. Even just the ability to custom build a palette and save some space for on the go is great.

Comparing the orange Olo to the orange Copic, there was virtually no difference in color. The other thing is that they don't have the heavy alcohol smell that Copics have. The dual tip connection feature is a great idea as well as being able to order handles, connectors and fills. I would highly recommend people purchase at least a small set to get an idea of what they can do. I give it 4 stars because blending wet over wet didn't seem to do anything on various papers."

No feeling at a loss about color options; I have more trouble limiting my pallet for projects.

I bought several of these Holbeins and about 4 of them work well for me, like, I love them, but the other 6 break and break and break. I can't even sharpen them--they sharpen into nothing, it's heart-breaking (and EXPENSIVE). I'm very sad and will not be buying these again, I'll stick to more consistent brands."

      "review_desc": "I like these pencils. They layer endlessly and blend well. The white pencil is really nice. However, I have two complaints. First is that some of the colors are very similar to the point that they're pretty much the same color. The purplish red, purple, and purple violet are all basically the same color. The pencils also appear to be magenta rather than purple. They could have added a couple more true purples and pinks rather than have 3 of the same color. I found that many other colors are also similar. I added some photos of my swatch chart, though many of them look even more similar in person. They could have eliminated these duplicates and added a better range of colors, such as true purples, pinks, skin tones, and a wider range of grays and browns. It seems more like a 72 set than a 120 set. My second complaint is that the metallic print on the barrel of the pencil is nearly impossible to read. This makes it extremely difficult to find a specific color. I find myself squinting and moving the pencil around to catch the light in just the right way. Despite these flaws, I am still rating them 4 stars because they are a dream to use."

They are slightly harder than Faber-Castell's more expensive Polychromos, so they hold a point better for some detail work, and they're very friction-free on paper. They're not quite as pigmented as the Polychromos line, but they do look good, and they're less expensive. I find them satisfying to use, the colors are nice, and they layer well. The white isn't particularly opaque, but I don't use white. They don't have lightfastness ratings, pigment info or color names on the pencils, but you can buy them open stock (in fact, I did), so I'd consider them student grade."

They are a bigger around and heftier than a regular pencil, and feel great in your hand. They have smooth and creamy cores and the available colors are dreamy and subdued. Not really for colored pencil art but more for sketching and perfect for that use. Derwent nailed it with these. I used a Derwent pencil in my mixed media coffee art in \"wheat\" color to add highlights for the milky areas. Will most likely buy all available colors. #sweepstakes"

The harder leads provide the image I will need for watercolor without leaving any graphite dust that would interfere with the watercolor and they also provide a clear image I can follow as I begin to paint. These pencils provide lines that stand up to the preparatory application of water for washes as well as continuing to show just where my piece needs additional attention. The range of hardnesses is also great: from relatively soft for sketching to very hard for the final underdrawing. And like all the other Derwent products they are high quality and a pleasure to use."

It has amazing tonal qualities from a light (gray) all the way to a deep black with almost no shine distinctive of the Ebony pencils. This is fast becoming my favorite graphite pencil and likely to replace the Ebonys in future work. I also got the Pitt graphite 12B and10B. I recommend them hands down to everyone that works in pencil as it feels good in the hand and is consistent in quality. I will be ordering a lot more so I can have them on hand when I use them up."

      "review_title": "Decent quality. Very clever marketing",
      "review_desc": "This is a cynical review, so I'll apologize now. First of all, these are good pencils. We are so inundated with digital technology: social media, short form video, phone notifications all day long. So, I'm rooting for pencil, paper and slow art. We've bought the old Blackwing Palominos and 60Xs and enjoyed using them. Had no problems with breaking leads or splintering cedar. But we paid a pretty penny for these pencils, likely more than they are worth... This is kind of like a special edition candy bar. Decent, but it's the same candy bar with a fancy/funny wrapper. What grade is a particular Blackwing lead? HB? 2H B? number 2? Who knows? I don't. Botanical artists have written blog posts on pencil brands, lead hardness, ability to sharpen and lifespan. They differ about favorite brands, but they agree that brands differ. So, lead grades aren't a precise science. I'll admit that a 2H Hi Uni and a 2H Tombow are different hardnesses. But when you just get a grade of \"firm\" it seems a bit loosy goosey. And expensive. For comparison, the beloved Tombow Mono is about $1.50 per pencil and you know exactly what you are getting. No pretty boxes or paint finishes, but cheaper, more consistent, and with a long track record. You could spend as much money on a Hi Uni as a Blackwing Era pencil and again you will have a pretty good idea of what you are getting with the Hi Uni. The Blackwings sure are fun to give as a gift, though. They present well and look nice on your recipient's desk. That's the brilliant aspect of the Blackwings. They get people interested in old, analog media. Again, this is great marketing and these are good pencils, but they are pretty pricey for a mystery pencil. So, I wouldn't recommend these to a friend (see below, I had to choose between \"yes\" and \"no\"). But I would give a set to a friend if the box design echoed a special event in their life."

I don't have statistics on how many of Wolff are broken, I bought only 2 and one of them appeared to be broken on the second sharpening."

I look forward to continuing to use these; so far they seem just fine in quality and craftsmanship.

The missing items were shipped quickly at no additional cost or inconvenience to me. I would certainly consider purchasing items from Dick Blick again based on this customer service experience.

The thick core offers tremendous versatility, especially if sharpened with a knife, and can accomplish both fine and broad lines, and a range of tones. The best pencil for sketching on the go, as all I need is this one pencil, my pocket knife to sharpen it, and maybe a bit of grey eraser! It's also excellent for finished pencil drawings! I can do a whole drawing with just this pencil, but sometimes I do like combining it with a General's Draughting one (for the preliminary sketch) and the Carbon Sketch (for the final, darkest black notes). General's makes very high quality pencils—made in the USA!—and I can't recommend their products enough! #sweepstakes"

I have always wanted to buy a pack of my own so when I finally got my own studio I decided that the time has come! The design is much more interesting than a regular yellow pencil, the lead stays sharp for a looong time and the erasers work flawlessly (not wearing down too quickly). I use these pencils for simple sketching or jotting down notes or even measurements on woodwork. They're just really good for every day use! I splurged a bit on the 72 pack because I often lose pencils or use up the eraser too quickly, but I can say these will last me a long time."

I think I've had maybe 5 pencils that had the lead break once even after being used by 500 students a week in my art room. That's five pencils for the whole school year. Never shred or splinter. I only put new pencils out after the mid term break because they got too short. I do have the students use little metal hand held sharpeners, not traditional ones. The amount of money saved on pencils is fantastic."

The wider pencil was great both because not all preschoolers have strong fine motor skills to grip a pencil and because the lead is also wider, which created a wider imprint for lines on the foam. Ticonderoga is an excellent brand. The only downside was that the pencils did not fit in my sharpeer so I had to carve tips with a knife."

      "review_desc": "I recently picked out 12 oil pastels from the open stock at a Blick store for my birthday, for every 3 my mother bought for me the price went down. I was able to build my own set. Not only do these have the absolute best pigment quality and smooth creamy texture but their size and shape reduce significantly the pain I usually have when drawing/painting from my rheumatoid arthritis- these are perfect for anyone with hand or wrist pain, not to mention you save money as the Grands last about 8-10 times as long as a regular sized oil pastel. Nobody can beat Sennilier when it comes to quality of their products, and no one else has such a wide variety of colors to choose from! I use these to sketch sculpture ideas (I can make the sketching look much more 3D w/these), in mixed media and encaustic projects, with OMS and wood turpentine for paintings, and even to decorate some of my porcelain sculptures. There is nothing to compare to these- my only problem is since I didn't buy these as a set with a box, I am struggling to find the right container to store them in so they won't break or rub off on each other too much."

I am very confident with the oil pastels upon other colors and different surfaces. A pure joy to explore now."

      "review_desc": "I reobtained Pentel last year because they were on the vegan list on Double Check Vegan (which is now crossed off), but looks like it is said otherwise in the Q&A. However, I'll not let my ethical bias get in the way of this review. First off, people are right about the smell. There is a gas-like smell to them (a smell I don't remember a while back when I had my first set many years ago). While it may not have bothered me too much, this may trigger headaches in others. It states long-lasting fade-resistant color. From my personal experience with testing and other artists who have done their own tests at home, I would NOT recommend these for commission works because most of the colors will not last long. I personally would keep these for sketchbook use and other fun things (If anything, you can do what I do and sell prints that'll last longer than the original art). Anyway, depending on weather, the blendability is a bit on the waxy side, but it'll definitely be waxy and crumbly if it's cold (goes the same with other alike oil pastels). The day was warmer when I worked on the female cardinal and had an easier time blending in colors than I did with the male cardinal, which was a bit cold in my room during the time of painting. The colors aren't deeply pigmented hence you can see the burnt sienna acrylic underpainting a bit on the white part of her belly. You can also see through the background of the purple fish. The amount of layering for these projects felt limiting, and it definitely didn't help when the underpaintings somewhat ended up a bit smooth than I wanted. They may not be Neopastels nor layer as much as a few other brans, but I still feel I can do plenty enough with these. Again, my ethical bias aside, I had fun doing these painterly pieces and I recommend them as starters (if you really insist on softer oil pastels that are better on your wallet than Neopastels, Holbein, and Sennelier, try either Lightwish, Mungyo or another alike brand)."

In addition, the artwork provided with this review is not my original design, I found an image online to use as a reference. That said, these are some really nice oil pastels at the student level. Some colors struggle to show up on darker paper hence why I took off a star. I wish I could give half points as I would rate these 4.5 out of 5 and not just a 4. I actually prefer using these on regular construction paper, I believe my image is done on Tru-Ray brand and is done on a light gray color. I found I liked them a bit less on heavily textured pastel papers like mi-teintes. Best used with high pressure and letting the pastels do most of the blending work. My examples was done completely using the 36 color set. This set is proof great work can be made with materials that don't have to break the bank."

I didn't knew what I was expecting as I'm still very new with oil pastels, comparing from the ones I used in the past. It's creamy, smooth, and layers/blends decently well. You can make very gorgeous artwork with these (with enough practice, of course). But it's fantastic for a beginner (or even advanced oil pastel artist), mainly due to the fact it's around $5-6 for a pack of 28. That's more than enough to get started. I do wish Crayola can make an even wider selection (that isn't the bulk one clearly for classroom use)."

Blick offers the best value, that's for sure."

The color is nice, and they last a long time (we've been using our for about a year now, and they're still going strong, although I did buy more white and black). I only gave them 4 stars out of 5, though, because they have a bit of a weird smell and they are hard to slide in and out of the box. I made velcro-closure wrappers for mine, which was an extra step. I hope I win the #sweepstakes"

I didn't have time to work with the oil/wax sticks for long, I just played with them a little bit, just to get an idea of how they feel and how I could integrate them into my mixed media art. So far I like them. I think they are what they say they are, a combo of oil and wax \"pastels\" (more % of wax than oil IMO), with good coverage, with vivid colors and some earthy ones included in the full set, clean pigments and excellent lightfastness. I think that they are close to the Neocolor I series in how they work, but with even better lightfastness, if that is even possible. For example, I saw that the ultramarine in the Neoart series is marked LF I (excellent), whereas the same pigment ultramarine in the Neocolor I is marked only as LF II (good), so I might choose the Neoart one to work on a piece that I would like to sell, just to be extra sure. My advice would be to buy several open stock sticks first and play with them before you commit to bigger sets, they are not cheap!"

These new Neoart pastels are one of my favorite things they've ever done! These are not the same as the Neoart crayons made 10-15 years ago. Those were a different texture and water-soluble. These are waterproof. Like seriously, perfectly waterproof. The texture is almost exactly like Neocolor, but with an even easier laydown, better blending and an even shinier, richer finish when rubbed smooth. The colors can absolutely appear to glow! I hope they expand the color range to match Neocolor II or Luminance, but do not replace Neocolor with these. They are similar but still very different products, and I would really miss the Neocolor! I plan to use these along with both types of Neocolor and my Luminance pencils. They all work great together! These are fantastic for sketching, and I'll have fun using them in sketchbooks and journals. They're also perfectly capable of making a pastel painting worthy of display. They lay down smoothly, layer well and blend nicely, without being smeary or muddy. It's really nice that they're waterproof and don't smudge as easily as Neopastel. They really are perfect for journals! I just want to see more colors!"

      "review_desc": "These oil pastels are really nice. They are creamy and blend easily. I used a Colour Shaper to blend and it worked well. Pastel wipes easily off the silicone tip. The 36 set has a nice assortment of colors including a number of good colors for skin tones. The sticks are much larger than my trusty Pentel Oil Pastels - both longer and at least double the size in diameter. Sticks seem a bit softer than the Pentels. I tried them out on a piece of Strathmore Acrylic paper which has a nice linen surface giving plenty of tooth for the oil pastel. The paper also provided a nice textured finish. The Faber-Castell Polychromous Pencils will work on top without sinking into the oil pastel. That's nice for some finish line work. I bought these for the color palette harmony with other products in the Faber-Castell line. The colors between products match giving a seamless color palette for mixed media projects."

I bought these for plein air studies and sketches, and the nice size case & sleeve (which fit in my small backpack & won't fall open while I'm walking) and wrote the previous review after only sampling the colors and without wiping off the surface of the sticks first. Though they did not show a white surface haze, like some waxy student brands when you first get them, they did have a somewhat hard surface layer that wiped right off, and now they really blend and behave quite nicely for a student brand, and are soft enough to allow dabs of impasto color on top of other layers, which is really wonderful & a pleasant surprise. At least so far (it's winter), they are not affected by heat going places with me in the car, as some other more expensive brands are, so they will be just perfect for what I got them for. I am going to wear out the lovely light blending colors way too soon, though ... fortunately, at the price Dick Blick sells them for, I will just buy more sets when colors run out. My 4 stars consider the price of this product. Of course, they are not better quality than Senneliers (which I gave a low review to because in my area, they simply melt into unusable goo), which are almost 6 times the price, but are a solid 4 stars compared to other student brands. I should have used them more before writing the other review!"

      "review_desc": "I bought the smallest set just out of curiosity, because they were a brand I hadn't used yet. I have used just about every other artist and student grade oil pastel sold in the US, and find they all have qualities that make them useful. However some stand out from the herd,and some don't. For me, these don't. The Faber Castell brand is very reliable,and these pastels have nothing really wrong with them. But, to me, they are not outstanding in any way compared to other brands in the student category. They are okay. I only bought the 12-piece set, and can only comment based on that. The dark colors would be hard to tell from an artist grade pastel. They seemed to lay down pretty smoothly and opaquely. The lighter tints were obviously waxier in texture and don't have the level of pigment that you would want for opacity. Other than that, the price per set is affordable, and these would be okay for beginning students, or for sketchbook use. I am neutral about recommending them - like I said, they are OK but not special. For what it's worth, if you are a beginner or need to save money, I would recommend the super-cheap Pentel oil pastels over these . Despite their price and student grade rating, they are quite nice in terms of pigment load, soft texture and range of colors."

They do allow me to seamlessly integrate my Faber Castell Polychromos pencils over them, or FC Albrecht Durer watercolor pencils for underpainting, as *most* (but not all) of the colors are good matches with those pencils, but they are quite hard and do not blend as well as other student brands. I think they'd be very frustrating for someone just starting in oil pastels. I would recommend Cray Pas Expressionist over these for beginners in this wonderful medium of oil pastel."

Opening the box for the first time, I was intrigued by how the sticks were covered in a layer of oil (check image) and had to wipe them off. I then made some swatches on the Winsor and Newton pastel paper (check images). Some good points: These oil pastels are soft and blendable, but not soft enough to layer over other soft oil pastels in my experience. Bad points: Compared to other artist grade oil pastels, the opaqueness of these sticks is inferior. Their coverage is also patchy and inconsistent (comparable to the expressionist line, just softer), most ostensibly seen with the Medium green stick. It might be because of the paper I was using, but for me so far these pastels have been underperforming as supposedly artist grade oil pastels. Unless they improve this product, I don't see myself returning to it. #sweepstakes"

These are only slightly creamier than the Expressionist OPs but my disappointment is minor. I usually don't put down more than two layers, nor do I use them for impasto techniques, but rather spread them and rub them in with my fingers or rubbing stumps. For that reason, extreme creaminess is not that important to me, and I get more mileage out of my OPs. Also, I'm too cheap to splurge on Holbein or Sennelier OPs. I will slurge on Holbein individual sticks as I use up my favorite colors, since the Specialists are not available in open stock...another disappointment. I'd expect any professional grade material to be available in open stock. Not a huge disappointment as the sets are very well priced, but who needs a ton of less used colors when you only need a couple. Overall, I'm very pleased with these #blicksweepstakes"

I combine them with a couple other quality brands in my art and I get phenomenal results. Specialist is very much on par with any professional brand. I am sad to see that Sakura apparently discontinued the open stock. Please consider bringing it back! At any rate, I will continue to buy the sets to augment my oil pastel collection."

I would recommend these for children, they are probably an excellent deal for teachers or child care providers. For artists they are okay in sketchbooks but like the Pentels they don't have much opacity and similarly leave a lot of crumbs when blending and added multiple colors. Better than the Pentels but if you want something that is a little better quality for sketchbooks and artwork that isn't as expensive as the Neopastel or Sennelier, go with the Cray-Pas Expressionists. In fact, I'd even recommend the cray-pas junior over these, unless you just want something super cheap for little ones. I gave it two stars instead of one because you can buy a giant pack of over 400 for something like $50 and unlike the Pentels you can buy just packs of white or black and they don't smell like gasoline, I think they're great for kids. #sweepstakes"

They provide excellent color vibrancy, much better than the \"gelatos\" and gel sticks that are popular right now--these stay vibrant when wet and don't need a gesso underpainting like the gelatos to get the same result. They also come in a great range of metallics, which I just got, and I am excited about using them! They lift easier and go down more opaque than my traditional watercolors or inks, and while this is a minus if I used them with the paints, it is a great way to get other effects when I use them on their own, especially granular textured effects. I am not a mixed media artist--what I look for as a watercolorist is pigment vibrancy and quality as well as lightfastness, and these provide all that. This was the first media outside of traditonal watercolor paints or inks that I have tried to use seriously, and they produced very exciting results."

It sounded like a good idea so I could get a sense of using them but toss them out if I hated them without being out too much money. I chose the Maped brand on Blick and when it arrived, boy was I pleased! I have since tried other budget friendly brands like Faber Castell and Mungyo but I just love my Maped brand. It has a smooth application with little hand pressure. The coverage is better than many brands in it's price range that I've tried. I like to blend 2 colors usually and that always guarantees complete coverage but just one application of the Maped covers just as well. I use Turpenoid to blend out larger areas and only my finger for smaller areas. Honestly, for just fooling around doing a first sketch these are amazing. Obviously not lightfast, just practical before doing a permanent piece. These are smooth, not grainy, good coverage, nice pigment, tapered ends, all the color choices you need with 24 sticks, and very reasonably priced. Recommended for casual sketching and doodling or outdoor first sketch impressions."

      "review_desc": "As a professional pastel artist, I have most every brand of pastel available. These are incredible pencils, they're like a secret gem. They're soft bodied and heavily pigmented (no dull, chalky ashy colors). My only wish is that they had a larger set of colors available. I would LOVE more deep dark jewel colors (reds, blues, purples, and greens). I grab for these pencils as often as my Caran D'ache. The pigment shafts are 4mm thick, on par with Derwent, Pitt, and CarbOthello; for the record Caran D'ache is 5mm. Incredible value, I highly, highly recommend these to anyone adding or beginning their pastel collection."

      "review_desc": "I am a pastel painter, and I prepare my own rigid surfaces using hardboard or wood panels. These panels may have an aggressive tooth when ready for the studio, My favorite pastels used to block in my background or underpainting are Townsend Terrages due to the fact that they seem to have a fine pumice property that suits my gessoed surface beautifully. The Townsend Terrages pastels grip and adhere to my surface's gritty texture and fills every square millimeter with beautiful pastel color. The adjacent colors I apply are easily blended for soft edges when the picture needs them. The large rectangular shape of Townsend Terrages allows for quick coverage of area without hard telltale streaks on the surface. The Townsend Terrages Manganese Violet 42 is an ideal pastel choice to manage the red violet hint of the atmosphere where the landscape or seascape meets the horizon. This particular tint really approximates the distant haze effect and pushes a pastel's horizon line deep into the perspective. I am happy I found this particular Townsend Terrages color as well many other wonderful pastels Townsend offers. The selection of \"darks\" is also an important part of my pastel palette."

The individual pastels vary in hardness, however, and the only things that keep me from giving these five stars are that some pastels are too hard and a bit scratchy and a couple of colors aren't lightfast, at least according to what I read from someone who tested them. But they are priced appropriately for those flaws. #sweepstakes"

They are also packaged oddly in these little plastic individual containers that you need to cut open to get at and because they have room to move around in the containers, they seem to break easily. I ordered 9 individual colors and 3 of them were broken. Blick replaced them, but one of the replacements also arrived broken even though they did a superb job of packing them in bubble wrap the second time. I won't be buying these again. I'll stick with Terry Ludwig or Sennelier soft pastels."

Art Spectrum Soft neutrals are not dull and will not deaden areas of a pastel painting. These medium soft slightly gritty sticks give back a little tooth as they're applied, making it easy to layer colors over each other."

      "review_desc": "On the whole, I could use Art Spectrum Soft Pastels exclusively. The color range may seem limited, but it really does cover what's needed for the general pastel artist who isn't trying to copy a subject. This particular tint of red, however, represents the one weakness: some of the tints have a lightfast rating of \"good,\" the equivalent of ASTMIII or Blue Wool Scale 4-5. Spectrum Red, Yellow Green, Flinder's Blue Violet, Spectrum Yellow, Jacaranda, Spectrum Orange being among them. If you're using these professionally I'd recommend downloading the color chart (found via the Resources tab) on Art Spectrum's website."

      "review_desc": "I \"tested the water\" by trying the box of 40 half sticks, a good place to start. These pastels are medium soft with a little grit that gives back some tooth as they're applied to the paper. I'm finally able to achieve the layering effect I couldn't get with softer pastels. Most of the colors (whole range) are rated either excellent or very good, but if lightfastness is important to you, go to Art Spectrum's website, open the Resources tab, and download the color chart for these Soft Pastels. Any that are marked with two stars are rated good, which is not lightfast enough for professional use."

This is, as expected, more messy than the hard pastels I usually use. This became immediately evident when I opened the shipping box and found the inside of the box completely coated in white pastel, with some making its way between the bottom flaps. Fortunately, I knew that this box contained soft pastels, and I was (somewhat) prepared for the transfer of white to every single thing between the door and what would be the (now multiplied in number) soft pastels' eventual home. Dick Blick has since proven that they are able to successfully contain these pastels through the shipping process, so hopefully everyone will now receive theirs intact and with less need of a shower. These are satisfactorily soft pastels, and the titanium white is bright. Wear an apron, and keep your shop rags handy."

The price per stick is very reasonable as well. More pastelists should look at these as a serious alternative for all genres of work."

The color palette is the same in the new W&N oil pastel set for those who like to use oil pastels as their pastel underpainting. Attached test drawing of spheres is on vellum cardstock. Pros: Pigmented, soft, finger blendable, good color range in the 30 set. Soft color shapers also work as blenders. Cons: No open stock. A 15 set might be an option to refill commonly used colors in the 30 set as needed. Made in China. Hopefully, W&N supervises the Chinese manufacturing to ensure quality and non-toxic products."
