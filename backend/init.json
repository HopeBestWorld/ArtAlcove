The stretcher bars are reinforced with cross bars, very sturdy, hefty, and square. The canvas was a bit loose in one corner, (which is to be expected with changes in temperature during shipping), but I had no problem straightening it out, tight as a drum, when I applied the keys to the bars in the back. The linen is a nice medium texture. Excellent quality for a good price."

Changes in humidity can cause the canvas to slacken at any time, so a canvas that's well-stretched by the manufacturer may be taut in our warehouse and looser when it arrives to you.

Mine are 24 x 30 inches and have one crossbar for support. Adequate extra canvas should you need to restretch. Corner folds good not great. Stretch is quite tight. Plenty of staples. Canvas looks to me like Fredrix Yankee, good tooth, fairly heavy, and though only 2 coats of gesso I've not noticed any bleed-through even with pours. Comes with wooden keys for the corners but some are too thick for the slots, the only knock. You could do a little better on some of these points but you'd pay 75% more."

It comes already primed which made it easy to get started. It's a bit heavier weight cloth than regular canvas, but I actually liked that better, since I am using a mix of regular acrylic, heavy body acrylic, and some other media on this piece. Unfortunately due to a health issue I have not been able to work on the piece much to show any photos ( it is also going to be a surprise gift). Liquitex has made a great product, one that I will be using exclusively from now on.

      "review_desc": "I'm not a huge fan of Winsor & Newton, especially since they've been bought out by the ColArt Group. But I have to admit, their stretched cotton canvas is the best you can get. If you want better quality than this, you'll be stretching your own. My biggest problem with pre-stretched canvas has always been canvas tightness. I like my canvas nice and tight. I don't want it wiggling around while I'm trying to paint. This canvas is relatively tight right out of the package. And it comes with these cool adjustable wedges. These wedges take it to the next level. So if you work on cotton canvas, and you prefer to buy pre-stretched, I highly recommend that you give this product a try."

Little bit wrinkly on glued edge and the disc had a flat part like they couldn't quite cut a perfectly round pressed wood disc. I think framing might solve the aesthetic wobble. Will keep because it is too cheap to return & it's so tiny it's not worth the carbon footprint a return would entail. Fredrix is my go to canvas. Normally they provide perfect canvases.

However, fine linens often have an open weave where light can shine through the priming. In addition, in fine weaves it's not unusual for the priming to penetrate and show white spots on the back of the fabric, but since the canvas has been sized (and the sizing is clear), there is no harm to the linen fibers. Both characteristics are sometimes mistaken for pinholes, but they are not holes and not flaws. Nonetheless, we welcome you to return any item that does not meet your expectations.

      "review_desc": "We’re sorry to hear that your experience with this canvas has been an unhappy one. Changes in humidity can cause the canvas to slacken, and you can tighten the canvas using the corner keys that are pre-installed in the stretcher frame for this purpose. If the wood frame is warped, the best place to start is by removing any tensioning keys you’ve inserted and move the canvases away from any source of humidity. The frame may straighten if some stress that's causing it to bow can be removed, but it’s not uncommon with warped canvases that the canvas fabric must be removed and put on new stretcher bars. Our Product Information Team is more than happy to assist with the materials and techniques you would need. Product Specialists are available weekdays from 8am to 5:30pm CST at 1-800-933-2542 or info@dickblick.com, and they're happy to help!"

Anyway, a few years back I suffered a stroke which somewhat curtailed my model hobby that started again after I retired. So these past four years I got back into coloring books. Not all the time mind you but just to break the boredom. Then this past month I purchased some adult based coloring books for markers, and that got me to thinking about these markers I had down in my studio cabinet. Lo and behold, they are still quite functional, but I have a few that after reopening the caps, they start to dry out until I put the cap back on and let it rest for a day or two. I think a new set is in the future. Yet, after almost 40 years, I can't complain about a very good purchase."

My only issue is when i bought them from DickBlick.com is that the price originally said free shipping on purchases over a dollar amount that i definitely exceeded with a 72 color Copic marker purchase. Then a few days later i got an email saying they couldn't cover the shipping cost. I feel like this was a bait-and-switch. I already was expecting shipping so i payed the EXTRA $ just to get them shipped. That didn't leave me with a great feeling about ordering from your website ever again. I live in Hawaii, USA. If you do not include Alaska and Hawaii in your free shipping offer then you should change your website to specifically say \"Free shipping in the continental United states. Does not include Alaska and Hawaii.\" Aloha, Tammi"

I didn't know when I bought them that they had replacement cartridges, it's a great idea. Even just the ability to custom build a palette and save some space for on the go is great.

Comparing the orange Olo to the orange Copic, there was virtually no difference in color. The other thing is that they don't have the heavy alcohol smell that Copics have. The dual tip connection feature is a great idea as well as being able to order handles, connectors and fills. I would highly recommend people purchase at least a small set to get an idea of what they can do. I give it 4 stars because blending wet over wet didn't seem to do anything on various papers."

No feeling at a loss about color options; I have more trouble limiting my pallet for projects.

I bought several of these Holbeins and about 4 of them work well for me, like, I love them, but the other 6 break and break and break. I can't even sharpen them--they sharpen into nothing, it's heart-breaking (and EXPENSIVE). I'm very sad and will not be buying these again, I'll stick to more consistent brands."

      "review_desc": "I like these pencils. They layer endlessly and blend well. The white pencil is really nice. However, I have two complaints. First is that some of the colors are very similar to the point that they're pretty much the same color. The purplish red, purple, and purple violet are all basically the same color. The pencils also appear to be magenta rather than purple. They could have added a couple more true purples and pinks rather than have 3 of the same color. I found that many other colors are also similar. I added some photos of my swatch chart, though many of them look even more similar in person. They could have eliminated these duplicates and added a better range of colors, such as true purples, pinks, skin tones, and a wider range of grays and browns. It seems more like a 72 set than a 120 set. My second complaint is that the metallic print on the barrel of the pencil is nearly impossible to read. This makes it extremely difficult to find a specific color. I find myself squinting and moving the pencil around to catch the light in just the right way. Despite these flaws, I am still rating them 4 stars because they are a dream to use."

They are slightly harder than Faber-Castell's more expensive Polychromos, so they hold a point better for some detail work, and they're very friction-free on paper. They're not quite as pigmented as the Polychromos line, but they do look good, and they're less expensive. I find them satisfying to use, the colors are nice, and they layer well. The white isn't particularly opaque, but I don't use white. They don't have lightfastness ratings, pigment info or color names on the pencils, but you can buy them open stock (in fact, I did), so I'd consider them student grade."

They are a bigger around and heftier than a regular pencil, and feel great in your hand. They have smooth and creamy cores and the available colors are dreamy and subdued. Not really for colored pencil art but more for sketching and perfect for that use. Derwent nailed it with these. I used a Derwent pencil in my mixed media coffee art in \"wheat\" color to add highlights for the milky areas. Will most likely buy all available colors. #sweepstakes"

The harder leads provide the image I will need for watercolor without leaving any graphite dust that would interfere with the watercolor and they also provide a clear image I can follow as I begin to paint. These pencils provide lines that stand up to the preparatory application of water for washes as well as continuing to show just where my piece needs additional attention. The range of hardnesses is also great: from relatively soft for sketching to very hard for the final underdrawing. And like all the other Derwent products they are high quality and a pleasure to use."

It has amazing tonal qualities from a light (gray) all the way to a deep black with almost no shine distinctive of the Ebony pencils. This is fast becoming my favorite graphite pencil and likely to replace the Ebonys in future work. I also got the Pitt graphite 12B and10B. I recommend them hands down to everyone that works in pencil as it feels good in the hand and is consistent in quality. I will be ordering a lot more so I can have them on hand when I use them up."

      "review_title": "Decent quality. Very clever marketing",
      "review_desc": "This is a cynical review, so I'll apologize now. First of all, these are good pencils. We are so inundated with digital technology: social media, short form video, phone notifications all day long. So, I'm rooting for pencil, paper and slow art. We've bought the old Blackwing Palominos and 60Xs and enjoyed using them. Had no problems with breaking leads or splintering cedar. But we paid a pretty penny for these pencils, likely more than they are worth... This is kind of like a special edition candy bar. Decent, but it's the same candy bar with a fancy/funny wrapper. What grade is a particular Blackwing lead? HB? 2H B? number 2? Who knows? I don't. Botanical artists have written blog posts on pencil brands, lead hardness, ability to sharpen and lifespan. They differ about favorite brands, but they agree that brands differ. So, lead grades aren't a precise science. I'll admit that a 2H Hi Uni and a 2H Tombow are different hardnesses. But when you just get a grade of \"firm\" it seems a bit loosy goosey. And expensive. For comparison, the beloved Tombow Mono is about $1.50 per pencil and you know exactly what you are getting. No pretty boxes or paint finishes, but cheaper, more consistent, and with a long track record. You could spend as much money on a Hi Uni as a Blackwing Era pencil and again you will have a pretty good idea of what you are getting with the Hi Uni. The Blackwings sure are fun to give as a gift, though. They present well and look nice on your recipient's desk. That's the brilliant aspect of the Blackwings. They get people interested in old, analog media. Again, this is great marketing and these are good pencils, but they are pretty pricey for a mystery pencil. So, I wouldn't recommend these to a friend (see below, I had to choose between \"yes\" and \"no\"). But I would give a set to a friend if the box design echoed a special event in their life."

I don't have statistics on how many of Wolff are broken, I bought only 2 and one of them appeared to be broken on the second sharpening."

I look forward to continuing to use these; so far they seem just fine in quality and craftsmanship.

The missing items were shipped quickly at no additional cost or inconvenience to me. I would certainly consider purchasing items from Dick Blick again based on this customer service experience.

The thick core offers tremendous versatility, especially if sharpened with a knife, and can accomplish both fine and broad lines, and a range of tones. The best pencil for sketching on the go, as all I need is this one pencil, my pocket knife to sharpen it, and maybe a bit of grey eraser! It's also excellent for finished pencil drawings! I can do a whole drawing with just this pencil, but sometimes I do like combining it with a General's Draughting one (for the preliminary sketch) and the Carbon Sketch (for the final, darkest black notes). General's makes very high quality pencils—made in the USA!—and I can't recommend their products enough! #sweepstakes"

I have always wanted to buy a pack of my own so when I finally got my own studio I decided that the time has come! The design is much more interesting than a regular yellow pencil, the lead stays sharp for a looong time and the erasers work flawlessly (not wearing down too quickly). I use these pencils for simple sketching or jotting down notes or even measurements on woodwork. They're just really good for every day use! I splurged a bit on the 72 pack because I often lose pencils or use up the eraser too quickly, but I can say these will last me a long time."

I think I've had maybe 5 pencils that had the lead break once even after being used by 500 students a week in my art room. That's five pencils for the whole school year. Never shred or splinter. I only put new pencils out after the mid term break because they got too short. I do have the students use little metal hand held sharpeners, not traditional ones. The amount of money saved on pencils is fantastic."

The wider pencil was great both because not all preschoolers have strong fine motor skills to grip a pencil and because the lead is also wider, which created a wider imprint for lines on the foam. Ticonderoga is an excellent brand. The only downside was that the pencils did not fit in my sharpeer so I had to carve tips with a knife."

      "review_desc": "I recently picked out 12 oil pastels from the open stock at a Blick store for my birthday, for every 3 my mother bought for me the price went down. I was able to build my own set. Not only do these have the absolute best pigment quality and smooth creamy texture but their size and shape reduce significantly the pain I usually have when drawing/painting from my rheumatoid arthritis- these are perfect for anyone with hand or wrist pain, not to mention you save money as the Grands last about 8-10 times as long as a regular sized oil pastel. Nobody can beat Sennilier when it comes to quality of their products, and no one else has such a wide variety of colors to choose from! I use these to sketch sculpture ideas (I can make the sketching look much more 3D w/these), in mixed media and encaustic projects, with OMS and wood turpentine for paintings, and even to decorate some of my porcelain sculptures. There is nothing to compare to these- my only problem is since I didn't buy these as a set with a box, I am struggling to find the right container to store them in so they won't break or rub off on each other too much."

I am very confident with the oil pastels upon other colors and different surfaces. A pure joy to explore now."

      "review_desc": "I reobtained Pentel last year because they were on the vegan list on Double Check Vegan (which is now crossed off), but looks like it is said otherwise in the Q&A. However, I'll not let my ethical bias get in the way of this review. First off, people are right about the smell. There is a gas-like smell to them (a smell I don't remember a while back when I had my first set many years ago). While it may not have bothered me too much, this may trigger headaches in others. It states long-lasting fade-resistant color. From my personal experience with testing and other artists who have done their own tests at home, I would NOT recommend these for commission works because most of the colors will not last long. I personally would keep these for sketchbook use and other fun things (If anything, you can do what I do and sell prints that'll last longer than the original art). Anyway, depending on weather, the blendability is a bit on the waxy side, but it'll definitely be waxy and crumbly if it's cold (goes the same with other alike oil pastels). The day was warmer when I worked on the female cardinal and had an easier time blending in colors than I did with the male cardinal, which was a bit cold in my room during the time of painting. The colors aren't deeply pigmented hence you can see the burnt sienna acrylic underpainting a bit on the white part of her belly. You can also see through the background of the purple fish. The amount of layering for these projects felt limiting, and it definitely didn't help when the underpaintings somewhat ended up a bit smooth than I wanted. They may not be Neopastels nor layer as much as a few other brans, but I still feel I can do plenty enough with these. Again, my ethical bias aside, I had fun doing these painterly pieces and I recommend them as starters (if you really insist on softer oil pastels that are better on your wallet than Neopastels, Holbein, and Sennelier, try either Lightwish, Mungyo or another alike brand)."

In addition, the artwork provided with this review is not my original design, I found an image online to use as a reference. That said, these are some really nice oil pastels at the student level. Some colors struggle to show up on darker paper hence why I took off a star. I wish I could give half points as I would rate these 4.5 out of 5 and not just a 4. I actually prefer using these on regular construction paper, I believe my image is done on Tru-Ray brand and is done on a light gray color. I found I liked them a bit less on heavily textured pastel papers like mi-teintes. Best used with high pressure and letting the pastels do most of the blending work. My examples was done completely using the 36 color set. This set is proof great work can be made with materials that don't have to break the bank."

I didn't knew what I was expecting as I'm still very new with oil pastels, comparing from the ones I used in the past. It's creamy, smooth, and layers/blends decently well. You can make very gorgeous artwork with these (with enough practice, of course). But it's fantastic for a beginner (or even advanced oil pastel artist), mainly due to the fact it's around $5-6 for a pack of 28. That's more than enough to get started. I do wish Crayola can make an even wider selection (that isn't the bulk one clearly for classroom use)."

Blick offers the best value, that's for sure."

The color is nice, and they last a long time (we've been using our for about a year now, and they're still going strong, although I did buy more white and black). I only gave them 4 stars out of 5, though, because they have a bit of a weird smell and they are hard to slide in and out of the box. I made velcro-closure wrappers for mine, which was an extra step. I hope I win the #sweepstakes"

I didn't have time to work with the oil/wax sticks for long, I just played with them a little bit, just to get an idea of how they feel and how I could integrate them into my mixed media art. So far I like them. I think they are what they say they are, a combo of oil and wax \"pastels\" (more % of wax than oil IMO), with good coverage, with vivid colors and some earthy ones included in the full set, clean pigments and excellent lightfastness. I think that they are close to the Neocolor I series in how they work, but with even better lightfastness, if that is even possible. For example, I saw that the ultramarine in the Neoart series is marked LF I (excellent), whereas the same pigment ultramarine in the Neocolor I is marked only as LF II (good), so I might choose the Neoart one to work on a piece that I would like to sell, just to be extra sure. My advice would be to buy several open stock sticks first and play with them before you commit to bigger sets, they are not cheap!"

These new Neoart pastels are one of my favorite things they've ever done! These are not the same as the Neoart crayons made 10-15 years ago. Those were a different texture and water-soluble. These are waterproof. Like seriously, perfectly waterproof. The texture is almost exactly like Neocolor, but with an even easier laydown, better blending and an even shinier, richer finish when rubbed smooth. The colors can absolutely appear to glow! I hope they expand the color range to match Neocolor II or Luminance, but do not replace Neocolor with these. They are similar but still very different products, and I would really miss the Neocolor! I plan to use these along with both types of Neocolor and my Luminance pencils. They all work great together! These are fantastic for sketching, and I'll have fun using them in sketchbooks and journals. They're also perfectly capable of making a pastel painting worthy of display. They lay down smoothly, layer well and blend nicely, without being smeary or muddy. It's really nice that they're waterproof and don't smudge as easily as Neopastel. They really are perfect for journals! I just want to see more colors!"

      "review_desc": "These oil pastels are really nice. They are creamy and blend easily. I used a Colour Shaper to blend and it worked well. Pastel wipes easily off the silicone tip. The 36 set has a nice assortment of colors including a number of good colors for skin tones. The sticks are much larger than my trusty Pentel Oil Pastels - both longer and at least double the size in diameter. Sticks seem a bit softer than the Pentels. I tried them out on a piece of Strathmore Acrylic paper which has a nice linen surface giving plenty of tooth for the oil pastel. The paper also provided a nice textured finish. The Faber-Castell Polychromous Pencils will work on top without sinking into the oil pastel. That's nice for some finish line work. I bought these for the color palette harmony with other products in the Faber-Castell line. The colors between products match giving a seamless color palette for mixed media projects."

I bought these for plein air studies and sketches, and the nice size case & sleeve (which fit in my small backpack & won't fall open while I'm walking) and wrote the previous review after only sampling the colors and without wiping off the surface of the sticks first. Though they did not show a white surface haze, like some waxy student brands when you first get them, they did have a somewhat hard surface layer that wiped right off, and now they really blend and behave quite nicely for a student brand, and are soft enough to allow dabs of impasto color on top of other layers, which is really wonderful & a pleasant surprise. At least so far (it's winter), they are not affected by heat going places with me in the car, as some other more expensive brands are, so they will be just perfect for what I got them for. I am going to wear out the lovely light blending colors way too soon, though ... fortunately, at the price Dick Blick sells them for, I will just buy more sets when colors run out. My 4 stars consider the price of this product. Of course, they are not better quality than Senneliers (which I gave a low review to because in my area, they simply melt into unusable goo), which are almost 6 times the price, but are a solid 4 stars compared to other student brands. I should have used them more before writing the other review!"

      "review_desc": "I bought the smallest set just out of curiosity, because they were a brand I hadn't used yet. I have used just about every other artist and student grade oil pastel sold in the US, and find they all have qualities that make them useful. However some stand out from the herd,and some don't. For me, these don't. The Faber Castell brand is very reliable,and these pastels have nothing really wrong with them. But, to me, they are not outstanding in any way compared to other brands in the student category. They are okay. I only bought the 12-piece set, and can only comment based on that. The dark colors would be hard to tell from an artist grade pastel. They seemed to lay down pretty smoothly and opaquely. The lighter tints were obviously waxier in texture and don't have the level of pigment that you would want for opacity. Other than that, the price per set is affordable, and these would be okay for beginning students, or for sketchbook use. I am neutral about recommending them - like I said, they are OK but not special. For what it's worth, if you are a beginner or need to save money, I would recommend the super-cheap Pentel oil pastels over these . Despite their price and student grade rating, they are quite nice in terms of pigment load, soft texture and range of colors."

They do allow me to seamlessly integrate my Faber Castell Polychromos pencils over them, or FC Albrecht Durer watercolor pencils for underpainting, as *most* (but not all) of the colors are good matches with those pencils, but they are quite hard and do not blend as well as other student brands. I think they'd be very frustrating for someone just starting in oil pastels. I would recommend Cray Pas Expressionist over these for beginners in this wonderful medium of oil pastel."

Opening the box for the first time, I was intrigued by how the sticks were covered in a layer of oil (check image) and had to wipe them off. I then made some swatches on the Winsor and Newton pastel paper (check images). Some good points: These oil pastels are soft and blendable, but not soft enough to layer over other soft oil pastels in my experience. Bad points: Compared to other artist grade oil pastels, the opaqueness of these sticks is inferior. Their coverage is also patchy and inconsistent (comparable to the expressionist line, just softer), most ostensibly seen with the Medium green stick. It might be because of the paper I was using, but for me so far these pastels have been underperforming as supposedly artist grade oil pastels. Unless they improve this product, I don't see myself returning to it. #sweepstakes"

These are only slightly creamier than the Expressionist OPs but my disappointment is minor. I usually don't put down more than two layers, nor do I use them for impasto techniques, but rather spread them and rub them in with my fingers or rubbing stumps. For that reason, extreme creaminess is not that important to me, and I get more mileage out of my OPs. Also, I'm too cheap to splurge on Holbein or Sennelier OPs. I will slurge on Holbein individual sticks as I use up my favorite colors, since the Specialists are not available in open stock...another disappointment. I'd expect any professional grade material to be available in open stock. Not a huge disappointment as the sets are very well priced, but who needs a ton of less used colors when you only need a couple. Overall, I'm very pleased with these #blicksweepstakes"

I combine them with a couple other quality brands in my art and I get phenomenal results. Specialist is very much on par with any professional brand. I am sad to see that Sakura apparently discontinued the open stock. Please consider bringing it back! At any rate, I will continue to buy the sets to augment my oil pastel collection."

I would recommend these for children, they are probably an excellent deal for teachers or child care providers. For artists they are okay in sketchbooks but like the Pentels they don't have much opacity and similarly leave a lot of crumbs when blending and added multiple colors. Better than the Pentels but if you want something that is a little better quality for sketchbooks and artwork that isn't as expensive as the Neopastel or Sennelier, go with the Cray-Pas Expressionists. In fact, I'd even recommend the cray-pas junior over these, unless you just want something super cheap for little ones. I gave it two stars instead of one because you can buy a giant pack of over 400 for something like $50 and unlike the Pentels you can buy just packs of white or black and they don't smell like gasoline, I think they're great for kids. #sweepstakes"

They provide excellent color vibrancy, much better than the \"gelatos\" and gel sticks that are popular right now--these stay vibrant when wet and don't need a gesso underpainting like the gelatos to get the same result. They also come in a great range of metallics, which I just got, and I am excited about using them! They lift easier and go down more opaque than my traditional watercolors or inks, and while this is a minus if I used them with the paints, it is a great way to get other effects when I use them on their own, especially granular textured effects. I am not a mixed media artist--what I look for as a watercolorist is pigment vibrancy and quality as well as lightfastness, and these provide all that. This was the first media outside of traditonal watercolor paints or inks that I have tried to use seriously, and they produced very exciting results."

It sounded like a good idea so I could get a sense of using them but toss them out if I hated them without being out too much money. I chose the Maped brand on Blick and when it arrived, boy was I pleased! I have since tried other budget friendly brands like Faber Castell and Mungyo but I just love my Maped brand. It has a smooth application with little hand pressure. The coverage is better than many brands in it's price range that I've tried. I like to blend 2 colors usually and that always guarantees complete coverage but just one application of the Maped covers just as well. I use Turpenoid to blend out larger areas and only my finger for smaller areas. Honestly, for just fooling around doing a first sketch these are amazing. Obviously not lightfast, just practical before doing a permanent piece. These are smooth, not grainy, good coverage, nice pigment, tapered ends, all the color choices you need with 24 sticks, and very reasonably priced. Recommended for casual sketching and doodling or outdoor first sketch impressions."

      "review_desc": "As a professional pastel artist, I have most every brand of pastel available. These are incredible pencils, they're like a secret gem. They're soft bodied and heavily pigmented (no dull, chalky ashy colors). My only wish is that they had a larger set of colors available. I would LOVE more deep dark jewel colors (reds, blues, purples, and greens). I grab for these pencils as often as my Caran D'ache. The pigment shafts are 4mm thick, on par with Derwent, Pitt, and CarbOthello; for the record Caran D'ache is 5mm. Incredible value, I highly, highly recommend these to anyone adding or beginning their pastel collection."

      "review_desc": "I am a pastel painter, and I prepare my own rigid surfaces using hardboard or wood panels. These panels may have an aggressive tooth when ready for the studio, My favorite pastels used to block in my background or underpainting are Townsend Terrages due to the fact that they seem to have a fine pumice property that suits my gessoed surface beautifully. The Townsend Terrages pastels grip and adhere to my surface's gritty texture and fills every square millimeter with beautiful pastel color. The adjacent colors I apply are easily blended for soft edges when the picture needs them. The large rectangular shape of Townsend Terrages allows for quick coverage of area without hard telltale streaks on the surface. The Townsend Terrages Manganese Violet 42 is an ideal pastel choice to manage the red violet hint of the atmosphere where the landscape or seascape meets the horizon. This particular tint really approximates the distant haze effect and pushes a pastel's horizon line deep into the perspective. I am happy I found this particular Townsend Terrages color as well many other wonderful pastels Townsend offers. The selection of \"darks\" is also an important part of my pastel palette."

The individual pastels vary in hardness, however, and the only things that keep me from giving these five stars are that some pastels are too hard and a bit scratchy and a couple of colors aren't lightfast, at least according to what I read from someone who tested them. But they are priced appropriately for those flaws. #sweepstakes"

They are also packaged oddly in these little plastic individual containers that you need to cut open to get at and because they have room to move around in the containers, they seem to break easily. I ordered 9 individual colors and 3 of them were broken. Blick replaced them, but one of the replacements also arrived broken even though they did a superb job of packing them in bubble wrap the second time. I won't be buying these again. I'll stick with Terry Ludwig or Sennelier soft pastels."

The color range may seem limited, but it really does cover what's needed for the general pastel artist who isn't trying to copy a subject. This particular tint of red, however, represents the one weakness: some of the tints have a lightfast rating of \"good,\" the equivalent of ASTMIII or Blue Wool Scale 4-5. Spectrum Red, Yellow Green, Flinder's Blue Violet, Spectrum Yellow, Jacaranda, Spectrum Orange being among them. If you're using these professionally I'd recommend downloading the color chart (found via the Resources tab) on Art Spectrum's website."

These pastels are medium soft with a little grit that gives back some tooth as they're applied to the paper. I'm finally able to achieve the layering effect I couldn't get with softer pastels. Most of the colors (whole range) are rated either excellent or very good, but if lightfastness is important to you, go to Art Spectrum's website, open the Resources tab, and download the color chart for these Soft Pastels. Any that are marked with two stars are rated good, which is not lightfast enough for professional use."

This is, as expected, more messy than the hard pastels I usually use. This became immediately evident when I opened the shipping box and found the inside of the box completely coated in white pastel, with some making its way between the bottom flaps. Fortunately, I knew that this box contained soft pastels, and I was (somewhat) prepared for the transfer of white to every single thing between the door and what would be the (now multiplied in number) soft pastels' eventual home. Dick Blick has since proven that they are able to successfully contain these pastels through the shipping process, so hopefully everyone will now receive theirs intact and with less need of a shower. These are satisfactorily soft pastels, and the titanium white is bright. Wear an apron, and keep your shop rags handy."

The color palette is the same in the new W&N oil pastel set for those who like to use oil pastels as their pastel underpainting. Attached test drawing of spheres is on vellum cardstock. Pros: Pigmented, soft, finger blendable, good color range in the 30 set. Soft color shapers also work as blenders. Cons: No open stock. A 15 set might be an option to refill commonly used colors in the 30 set as needed. Made in China. Hopefully, W&N supervises the Chinese manufacturing to ensure quality and non-toxic products."

      "review_desc": "Golden Open Acrylics changed the game for acrylic painters. You can mix large amounts of paint and have a palette that stays workable for days, avoiding wasted paint and time remixing. Colors blend on the substrate like oils for beautiful soft edges. I use Open titanium white for tinting regular heavy-body paint, which lets me control the drying time, leveraging the advantage of using fast-drying acrylic paint. Using an Open medium helps control the drying time for darker colors. You will have to take care when using water. Water may reactivate touch-dry Open paint on your substrate and you could end up pulling it right off, even with a brush loaded with paint. But with practice, you'll find the limits of what works and doesn't work. The bottom line is, your options will be more Open with Golden Open acrylics. The widemouth 8 oz jar makes it easy to use every bit of paint. Putting some plastic wrap over the top before closing the jar makes it easy to open every time. I'd give Open paints a 5-star review anyway. It's just gravy to do it for #sweepstakes"

In this case, it's so poorly pigmented to the point of acting like dirty high flow medium when mixed with other brands' acrylic inks or with other Golden High Flow paints.

      "review_desc": "We use this paint in a Community Arts class for interior and exterior murals, and in general art classes for projects. The coverage is phenomenal, it blends really well, and the colors are vibrant. The only negative point is the containers they come in. There isn't an easy way to pour paint out for distribution, and what ultimately happens is that paint crusts up around the lip of the jar, the lid eventually won't go on correctly, and the paint dries out with only half of it used. Almost every jar has done this-- either it dries out completely, or it's just a thick, gelatinous mess by the time you get about half of it used. I wish they would come up with a better lid/container solution because this paint is such an affordable alternative."

Look at the tube and notice how much empty space there is that could hold a bolder type. Whoever laid this out must return to art school for some advertising classes. Don't forget, many older artists have enough trouble finding their glasses much less reading such minuscule type. Why not make it easier to read?"

The colors were rich, and my students were able to blend them to create other colors without making mud. We used them for paintings and paint pouring. I purchased another brand in a few colors and within two years they were separated and drying. I had no problems with the Chroma brand. I also purchased the pumps, which I do not recommend for long term storage. It was easier for my students to get a reasonable amount, but I needed to do an extensive clean out each spring or fall to use the pumps again. The colors I ran out of, I repurchased in the pint size for ease of pouring. I saw these paints, without pumps, at a workshop I attended at a local university, which is why I tried them initially."

      "review_desc": "I bought this shield to do precise erasing of botanical drawings. Because other reviewers complained about this shield being flimsy, and others talked up the Staedtler, I decided to buy both so that I could compare them. And they are different. This shield is about a centimeter longer than the Staedtler and the holes are a little larger, though they almost copy the original shapes. These holes are more rounded and not as narrow as the competitor's shield. I agree with others that the Westcott feels thinner and less robust. So I measured thickness with a micrometer. Yes, I actually did. The Westcott measures a pretty reproducible 0.09 mm in multiple places around its perimeter. The Staedtler, however, measures 0.12 mm. Again, I made multiple measurements around the perimeter of each and the Westcott is about 25% thinner. You really can feel the difference. In the end, though, they both function as an erasing shield just fine. But I don't think that the Westcott will prove to be as durable. It already has a divot (see photo). One of these will stay in my home; one will travel with my kit. Either way, they need a wallet or sleeve. The Staedtler will just fit in a wallet. The thinner Westcott is too big. It was interesting to compare these two, but I would probably buy two Staedtlers instead of one of each."

      "review_desc": "For those of my colleagues who are old enough to fondly remember the original Eberhard Faber Blackwing 602, it did have one notable Achilles Heel: its pink rubber eraser. Stiff when new, it became leather hard and crumbly when old. Yes, the pencil's ferule was designed to allow the user to exchange a new one, but to what avail? Your options were limited to those pink erasers. Today, the legendary Blackwing 602 has been resurrected with an eraser to match the quality of its smooth lead and aromatic cedar casing - a rarity in the pencil world. While this new incarnation of the 602 is a close match to the original, it's new pink replacement eraser is not - and that is a good thing! It is far superior to it. #sweepstakes"

It stays clean because the dirty parts rub off just like a gum eraser which also makes it gentle just like a gum eraser but able to be more precise. It cuts like butter with an exacto knife and can be easily shaped. I got this with some Kimberly pencils and thought it would be worthless since I had such bad memories of those pink erasers in my youth ruining pictures with smudges or pink marks. But the eraser comes in handy. It is still gentle but more aggressive than white erasers and works well with charcoal as long you handle the crumbs issue. I always keep a slice of this in my pencil bag."

      "review_desc": "This review is the counterpart to the review that I wrote about the inferior competitor to the Staedtler trading shield. I bought this shield (the Staedtler) to do precise erasing of botanical drawings. Because other reviewers complained about the Westcott shield being flimsy, and others talked up the Staedtler, I decided to buy both so that I could compare them. And they are different. This shield is about a centimeter shorter than the Westcott. This is not an issue and actually makes it a bit more portable. I agree with other reviewers that the Staedtler feels more sturdy. So I measured thickness with a micrometer. Yes, I actually did. The Westcott measures a pretty reproducible 0.09 mm in multiple places around its perimeter. The Staedtler, however, measures 0.12 mm. Again, I made multiple measurements around the perimeter of each and the Westcott is about 25% thinner. You really can feel the difference. They both function as an erasing shield just fine, however. In the end I think that this one, the Staedtler, will be more durable. The substantially thinner Westcott already has a divot (see photo). One of these will stay in my home; one will travel with my kit. Either way, they need a wallet or sleeve. The Staedtler will just fit in a wallet. The thinner Westcott is too big. It was interesting to compare these two, but I would probably buy two Staedtlers instead of one of each"

(Blick's own erasers work, Tombow pencil 2.3 round, and the Factis or Factus soap also are amazing for sketchers).

Smooth and softly textured, this eraser can get through multiple layers of varying lead hardnesses with ease. It leaves you with a nice, clean area to go in and redo if you've made a mistake. I also really like how it doesn't smear the graphite all over your work. You can use these erasers with a variety of brands; (woodless or wooded,) and even graphite chunks. They do an outstanding job of cleaning up and you go and after you've finished. If there was a version with sharp edges; I would buy it in a heartbeat."

Did a swatch sheet on Bristol Vellum with various lines of hatching, crosshatching, stippling, scribbling, etc. They show their characteristics well and are the same quality product of my student years. This particular set does what you would want for a pen & ink artist drawing set. I later purchased, judging by my swatch sheet effects, extra 102 (crow quill) & 107 hawk quill) nibs along with extra holders. This allows for ongoing work as some soak in the Speedball pen cleaner. The 56 \"student\" is a good way to begin as it is easy to control. The 108 flexible requires diligence but produces a line of varying thickness which can be quite nice but takes more practice than the others in holding and gliding across the surface. The Bristol smooth might be a better choice for practice."

There are a lot of different pen and ink sets out there, and not all of them are meant for writing -- I only discovered after I bought one kind of nib that it was only meant for pen and ink drawings and couldn't be used for lettering (strokes can only be made in one direction, downwards, and not up). Some nibs are good for some kinds of writing, and others for other kinds, so it helps to have a selection of nibs. This package is a good value for a beginner who's just figuring out what they want to do."

      "review_desc": "I found these Speedball calligraphy fountain pens after working with the Pilot Parallel pens for some time. The Pilot Parallels are great for calligraphy, but the smallest size nib they offer is 1.5mm, and the ink flows quite freely from them, making it difficult to produce smaller calligraphic letters. The Speedball pen nibs come in 1.1mm, 1.5mm, and 1.9mm and I've found that the ink flow is less heavy than the Pilot Parallel pens, so it's easier to produce those tiny letters, while still retaining the line variation necessary for great looking calligraphy. The pen body itself is nothing fancy, just sturdy plastic. It also features a small window so you can see when you're running low on ink. The cap is secure, and posts on the back of the pen nicely while writing or drawing. The only thing I don't love about these pens is that the interior of the pen body is made to only fit the short standard international fountain pen cartridges. There are little plastic bumps inside the pen body shaft which prevent any longer cartridges from fitting. These bumps actually hold the cartridge in place inside the pen when it's assembled, so be careful when disassembling the pen because the cartridge might fall out from the nib and spill ink. It would be nice to be able to fit a longer cartridge in there, but it's easy enough to change to a new cartridge, or refill the old one from an ink bottle with a flat syringe. Overall, these pens are a quality and completely affordable writing or drawing instrument."

      "review_desc": "I have not opened my new package of these but have used these in the past. These Maru nibs allow for extremely thin lines. although these nibs are designed for thin lines, they also are flexible enough for a fairly thick line. Some art supplies stores sell cheap pen holders for these round nibs which have a skinny handle. those cheap pen holders cause my hand to cramp up. The Kuretake Zig (Tachikawa) pen holder does not cramp my hand yet fits the round maru nib as well as the Saji, G, and School nibs. I believe many Shojo type manga artists use this nib for details such as hair. Because hair strands are so numerous this nib seems to dull faster than my other nibs. I think it is odd they only include 2 instead of 3 or more nibs in the package, still this is a very good nib. This nib allows for lines comparable to the finest Micron pens, but without the worries of breaking the tip. I would buy this in combination with either the G nib or School nib for figure drawing. The Saji is supposed to be used for backgrounds but can also produce figures."

      "review_desc": "I recently bought this Manuscript set. I'm a newish calligrapher. I decided I wanted to use the refillable cartridge and filled it with Higgins India Ink for fountain pens. It worked sort of ok for the smallest nib but not at all for the larger ones. I decided maybe the ink, which was opened and seemed ok to me, might be too thick for the pen. I removed the refillable cartridge and put on a standard black cartridge and voila! A different outcome altogether. Much smoother with no skipping using all nib sizes. So if you have trouble be sure to consider the ink you're using. And if you are not a seasoned calligrapher, remember to be sure you are holding the pen the way it is made to be held. I like the feel of the pen a lot."

I was using a \"G\" nib for this until I used the Speedball 99 and the 101 dip pen nibs. I created a sample comparison using my old \"G\" nib and various Speedball nibs. You can see the difference. No more boring standard line weight with these nibs. There is however a slight learning curve. A slight increase in pressure will result in a wider line. If you are new to dip pen nibs, you may want to try the Speedball 512 or 513 nib. They are firmer and easier to work with but, don't have as thick as a line that you can get with the 101 or 99. Blick has these prices for these nibs so cheap. Why not get one of each like I did and see for yourself? #sweepstakes"

Layering the purple and and greens makes a magnetic deep dark value. They adopt the sheen of the surface you draw on. If your paper is matte, they dry to a clean flat matte. If your paper has a very smooth finish, they develop a subtle sheen. The black is truly black. Even under direct sunlight I cannot detect any add-mixtures of pigments. The tips are consistently square with gentle precise rounding at the corners. That tends to make normal handwriting seem special, and good handwriting seem like Art. Acid free, archival \"safe.\" Fun to write with. Even more fun to sketch with! I'll definitely invest in more!"

However, after trying many alternatives, the Yasutumo meets most of those performance needs for me. I just have to work a bit harder to keep a sharp edge. I use the 2mm and 3.5mm for calligraphy, which were the two sizes on the Staedtler Duo, so I am happy Yasutumo offers them in the same set."

As you can see from my images (not my best lettering): - the Dark Green is pretty decent, as it's a true green and I was able to get nice crisp sharp lines. - The Red however, for some reason, didn't have sharp edges AND in-person, it looks more orange-red than a true red (however, from my photo, it looks red). Trust me... I'm picky with my reds and this is more of an orange red. - The Metallic Green is fairly decent. Again, edges not as crisp as the other green (maybe they sent me 2 bum/used pens?) and as you can see on the black paper, it shows up as a silver-ish green. Bottom line, I probably would not purchase again. Am looking for red & green chisel markers for Cmas (med to broad point) -- like the Elegant Writers. Maybe I'll try to \"sharpen\" these myself with my xacto knife. Even then, though, I'm disappointed with the red color. Decent price though!"

Yes, the drawing pads are more expensive and ivory color and only 24 sheets to a pad but it is beautiful fine, smooth paper and heavy enough for finish work. I splurge and buy a 1/2 dozen every year.

It is overall a nice hand lettering paper, but, this is not an expensive paper. I meant the paper will buckle, may bleed through and there are very little feathering. If you want something thick, doesn't bleed through and feather then use a hot pressed watercolor paper. This paper is perfect for practicing, doodling or write a cute little letter with. It may not be suitable for crafting or art."

It's almost like they lean towards the acrylic side more and then it says they can be used for outdoors as well.

I haven't used them as much yet, because they are about 4 dollars more than the others. So if I were to buy one or the other, so far I'd go for the cheaper version of this ink. But I need to use them more!"

      "review_title": "Holbein is great",
      "review_desc": "Let me start by saying these are quality inks. I thought they would be more opaque but here's my approach: 1: opacity- added Holbein gouache of similar tones to my inks. I still have to paint my colors twice on watercolor paper for full opacity. But this makes your inks more powerful than Holbeins acrylic gouache and In desired consistency. This will make your inks stronger than most available for purchase. Holbein I hope you're listening. We need more opaque colors that aren't pastel. This is a sure thing. 2: tip dry nib or airbrush- make a mix of glycerine/propylene glycol to make an acrylic retarder. I used vape juice bottles so I can add drops to however much I'm using at the time. This is the only way I was able to outline black with a nib. I add about 7-8 drops in a small cap and go to town. These are just things that have helped me out over the last few months. These aren't things that are necessary by any means. Just sharing some tricks that have made these my favorite new paints. I'm only leaving four stars because I feel like this ink has potential to be the absolute best if they added their gouache to it. Even to just make an extension off of this product. Then we'd have the opaque and transparent sets, that way you're making everyone happy. I also wish I could purchase bigger bottles. Overall Holbein has my business! The Japanese make amazing art supplies and I'm very happy that dick blick carries these products for all of us to try and use."

In the cartridge I've had no separation of the pigment, and the pen has worked perfectly since I refilled it, other than a bit of initial leaking but I suspect that was more due to my overfilling, as that resolved quickly once I started using it. I will keep using this for refills, and plan to get additional colors for my other Mont Blanc cartridges."

The 2 oz bottle holds a generous amount of ink, and its vibrant yellow color stands out for its striking opacity and smooth flow. This makes it perfect for everything from calligraphy and lettering to illustrations and fine art projects. One of the key highlights of this ink is its fluidity. It glides effortlessly on various surfaces, from traditional calligraphy paper to heavier mixed media paper, offering consistent, clean lines without clogging dip pens or brushes. The Primrose Yellow shade is lively, providing a sunny, vivid pop of color that holds its brightness even after drying. It dries to a smooth, satin finish and remains fade-resistant, keeping your artwork fresh and vibrant. The ink's rich pigmentation means that it works well on both light and dark surfaces, and it can also be mixed with other colors from the Speedball range for custom hues. It's highly versatile, making it ideal for calligraphy and adding decorative touches to cards, journals, and more. One minor drawback is that, like many lighter inks, Primrose Yellow may require a couple of layers on darker backgrounds to achieve full opacity. However, its buildable nature makes it easy to control the level of intensity. Overall, Speedball's Calligraphy Ink in Primrose Yellow is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to add vivid, high-quality ink to their creative toolkit. Its brightness, fluidity, and versatility make it a standout option for seasoned calligraphers and beginners."

There will be some separation that occurs, so you have to be sure to mix the ink prior to using - a long toothpick usually works best for this. If not mixed before applying, the ink will dry down with a slight yellow tint to it, and if over darker colors will not be as opaque. One small downside is that the ink easily \"beads up\" on the applicator during use, especially if you've shaken or even turned the bottle to mix the ink. Even if you wipe the excess off the bristles on the rim of the bottle, you have to keep an eye out for extra product that will bead up higher on the wand. These beads of ink will roll down the applicator and brush pretty quickly as you're using it, if you don't watch out. Overall the product is good, and I will continue to repurchase. #sweepstakes"

I'm gonna use it to the last drop like I usually do when I test inks, but so far amazing, of course not every ink is the same, I encourage to do a lot of research before buying white inks because they all have different factors, like opacity, the ability to draw over it again and not get a weird blue line or it to be stiff and rough, the viscosity level (I prefer very high), and much more! I think the only thing that might come close to this quality of ink is maybe Copic opaque white, though remember that the copic is a higher price and still in my opinion is not as good.

I was happily surprised at how strong and dense the color is (ultra black). It is blacker than \"black\" watercolor paint--it's even blacker than a Sharpie marker. Because it is liquid, it can be used in wet-on-wet washes at full strength, where it provides beautiful watery textures without noticeable granulation and few blooms. At full strength it dries with a sheen and the paint layer has a perceptible thickness sitting on top of the paper, which can make it stand out in a watercolor painting, so be aware of that."

      "review_title": "Worth Adjusting To",
      "review_desc": "I love using Higgins ink in all of my illustrations. I won't deny it. Using this ink rather than a watercolor paint gives a certain vibrancy you cannot achieve using another medium. Majority of the colors will say \"non-waterproof,\" but when working with it, you will find that if you find yourself spilling water on a completed piece, majority of the colors act as though they were \"waterproof.\" Out of my experiences with Black India, Russet, Red-Orange, Red, Violet, Blue, \"Green\", Turquoise, and Leaf-Green... The only colors which have proven themselves to move when re-dampened have been Blue and \"Green.\" On this note, WARNING: INK, especially INDIA INK will NOT come out of clothing! Now, the reason I put \"Green\" in quotation marks is because \"Green\" is far closer to a blue hue than any type of green... In fact, I typically use it when painting skies. You have got to be weary when choosing colors, the color you may think you want could end up looking entirely different. Use scrap paper when painting, see what it looks like dried before using it, too. Another thing about using these inks is how they blend. If you're new to the medium, it will shock you: Once the ink has dried on the paper, there is little to no chance of moving it. If you want a gradient, you must add it before it dries. This is both a blessing and a curse. If you let the ink dry before evening out the paint, you are left with a crisp line where the water's edge was, but if you plan on it drying, you are guaranteed layers which will not become muddy the more layers you add. Colors will blend with each other if you mix them while wet or on your palette, but if you allow the paint to dry before you add an extra color the DEPTH you achieve is far greater than if you were to attempt the same thing in any other medium. You can show distinct violets and distinct greens right to each other without becoming too muddy if you desire, you can't get that too easily with other mediums. It may also seem like you're buying a tiny bottle of ink, but just a few drops will go a long way. I started using Ink as my primary medium 6 months ago, and only recently have I started to begin replacing bottles. Higgins ink, like all art mediums alike, takes some getting used to. If you want to achieve high-intensity colors, Higgins ink is a good place to find it. If you are looking for a new challenge, I would highly recommend Higgins Ink. As the inks are mainly permanent and highly concentrated, do not buy for younger artists. Watercolors are great for kids, but if you're looking for something new to try, look into \"gouache.\" Happy Creating!"

      "review_desc": "I am using these, as well as the Yasutomo All Purpose Brushes, for Suminagashi. The size of these brushes (handle, overall diameter and belly) are larger than the All Purpose brushes with the same numbering system. This makes it much easier for me to hold multiple brushes in one hand. But the size difference is something to be aware of if you prefer to work with smaller brushes. Hair does fall out. At this price point that is to be expected. The best way to help with shedding is to properly remove starch when they arrive, inspect and then carefully remove the loose hair. Gently swirl the brush in the cup of your hand under cold, running water while cleaning. Lightly wipe on a lint free cloth to remove excess water. Avoid squeezing or pinching to remove water. Shape and hang to dry. Before any session I fan the dry bristles with my fingers to see if there are any loose hairs. I've had very little to no shedding with the 6 brushes I own. I've used them multiple times a day for two weeks. These brushes hold a nice amount of ink and surfactant. They also keep their shape after I've curved the bristles to change the angle of the toe. I would recommend these brushes over the marbling kit brushes. Half of those have lost many bristles even after gentle care."

However, please know that once the brush is broken in, the shedding should stop. If it doesn't, please give us a call at 1-800-723-2787, and our Customer Care Team will take good care of you!"

It is a sheep hair which answers the question of why it is a bit stiffer than my Holbein Hake series 1220 with goat bristles I think it is a very good brush for the money and otherwise. Some peoples reviews said it was cheaply made. Not at all. It is not a fancy original hake brush finish, sawn etc., but it does not look or feel cheap just because of metal holding the hair. I would describe it to be a simple brush and very inexpensive. I do recommend it because it does apply washes well, not stiff but a bit stiffer hair than goat hair. I already tested it. Nice short handle. And unlike Holbein Hake 1\" series 1220 brush, this one four times less expensive. Go for it, you will like it. Also great to smooth a wash. I bought one and in another order a second one."
