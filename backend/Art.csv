Sadly over the years I can only find pictures of 2 of my pieces, both of which have been lost to multiple house moves and didn't have the foresight to scan them in properly at the time.



I used to really enjoy doing gothic drawings when I was 14-16, particularly beasts, reapers, elements of horror etc.



That said, I've always been very happy with how this turned out and thought I would share. Maybe to try and revitalise a bit of creativity in myself, inspire me to some decent pencils and give it another shot.



Anyway I hope you enjoy! I may submit the 2nd one a little later :)",2022-12-16 11:16:39

I'll definitely be the first to admit that acrylics are suuuper tricky for realism since they dry SO fast. For this, I use a Sta-Wet palette (which can keep acrylics wet for weeks, even past a month at times), and I also use an acrylic medium (Golden and Liquitex are both excellent brands). Having a little spray bottle with water is super helpful, too. 

I was able to thin out the paint with the medium and work in layers to achieve the translucent/shiny effect. The medium also helps keep the paint wet for a bit longer so it's easier to blend, which is great!",2022-12-17 02:15:02

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

It’s not the nudity, obviously there are places where public non-sexual nudity is perfectly fine like some beaches etc, bare chests for men and women aren’t inherently sexual and are also perfectly fine in many contexts, even sexual nudity is fine in some settings such as certain clubs/groups and events.

The issue is when you force someone in public to be part of something sexual with you. It’s the issue of consent, respect, and safety.",2022-12-16 22:26:13

Every progression in the 'art industry' seems to be more and more about removing the challenge and self enrichment that led artists to pursue art in the first place. The product is more important than the process is the constant message we keep receiving. 

I think it's important for artists to take joy in the process, now more than ever. AI users get their product with none of the benefit of learning a lifelong skill, and I think that is an unfortunate outcome for them. Improved hand eye coordination, muscle memory, seeing the world in new and interesting ways, etc. Its all practice. I think a lot of them were told at a young age that art was only for the talented. If we can continue to emphasize the benefit of the practice of art rather than the product, I think that can help give us renewed purpose.",2022-12-16 22:10:13

Comment,1,j0hi9cd,,0,1671213642.0,"You're getting false positives. I have a bunch of pen on paper artwork I have done that I've made digital copies of on my computer and did no cloning whatsoever. All I did was play with levels and contrast, etc. to get it to look more like the original. None of the artwork was done digitally. 

I just dragged them onto Forensically and sure enough, its detecting clones under similar parameters as I detect clones in OP's image. The ones I uploaded were jpegs just like OP's. They are all very small ""clones"" not anything substantive and they all are in places that don't make any sense as to why you'd use them. Its mostly highlights which coming from jpegs are going to look like patterns to this software. The black and white image increases the likelihood of finding patterns. You're getting compression artifacts being detected as clones basically. 

[This post](https://headt.eu/How-to-Detect-Image-Manipulations-Part-2/) goes into comparing cloned images vs unaltered images in Forensically. Note that every one of the unaltered images has clones detected. 

Forensically is a good tool but you have to confirm the clones, not just assume every detection is a real clone. When you look at what its saying is cloned, it doesn't make sense that those are clones. There's no reason to clone a hair highlight for another hair highlight in this case.

A cool  
tortle monk and sorcerer I drew a while ago!  
Character:  
Reyes Starshell, Tortle Monk and Sorcerer  
Reyes  
Starshell hails from a tortle village nestled in the center of a large natural  
hot spring deep within the mountains. He is also one of a few special tortle,  
imbued with the power of a dragon in his heart. Related to a great red dragon  
that looks after his village, he trained his entire life to become a chosen  
guardian with the dragon's blessings.  
With his  
training complete, now his final test begins. He must travel to the unknown  
beyond his village and learn how to fully control the fire that burns in his  
heart.
